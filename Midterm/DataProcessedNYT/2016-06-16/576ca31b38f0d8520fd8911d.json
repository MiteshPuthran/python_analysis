Murray, passed away on June 12, 2016 at age 73. A native of Bayside, New York, Jane was an alumna of St. Helena's High School, Class of 1961, and Molloy College, Class of 1965. Jane was a wife, mother, friend and educator of boundless love, devotion and generosity. A teacher in the fullest sense of the term, Jane instilled in her children and her students the centrality of integrity, compassion and kindness, and imbued in them her insatiable intellectual curiosity. During her over fifty-year career, first in the New York City public school system, and, for the past 29 years, at The Ursuline School in New Rochelle, Jane was an unshakable advocate for her students and found joy in their success. In appearance, Jane personified elegance, but her legacy consists of the grace, magnanimity and nobility of spirit that she exemplified, and by which her family and countless friends will remember her. She is survived by her children, John, of New York, NY, Elizabeth, of Somerville, MA and James, of Yonkers, NY, her sister, Eileen Mulhern, and her husband, Eugene, of Stamford, CT and their children and grandchildren, and her brother, John Riordan, and his wife, Jane, of Southampton, NY.

McGrath & Son Funeral Home, Bronxville, NY from 2-4pm and 7-9pm and funeral mass on Friday, June 17, 2016 at the Church of St. Joseph's, Bronxville, NY, at 10:45am Donations may be made in her name to the James J.
