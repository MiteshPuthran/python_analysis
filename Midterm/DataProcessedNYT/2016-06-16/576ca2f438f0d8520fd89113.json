Constance Howland Manning, a resident of Smith Ranch Homes in the city of San Rafael, California, passed away peacefully on June 7, 2016, after an extended and difficult illness. She was born on June 12, 1927, the daughter of Horace Tomlinson Howland and Adelaide O'Connor Howland, of New Rochelle, New York. She grew up in New Rochelle and graduated from Barnard College in New York City in 1949. In 1952, while returning from a vacation in Europe on the French Line steamship \"Liberte\", she met her future husband, Ellis Manning, Jr., a lawyer engaged in the practice of law in Washington, D. C. They were married in 1953 and had four children in a marriage of almost 63 years. Connie was a devoted homemaker. She took great joy in being actively involved in her children's lives throughout their school days, and beyond. She is survived by her husband, by three of her four children, and by five grandchildren. Her surviving children are: Ellis W. Manning, of West Chester, Pennsylvania; Peter T. Manning, of Middletown, Rhode Island; and Elizabeth H. Manning, of Mill Valley, California. During her marriage, Connie and her family lived for 21 years in Washington, D.C. An avid reader, she enjoyed working at the Francis Scott Key Bookshop in Georgetown. She and her husband relocated to the community known as Scarborough in the village of Briarcliff Manor, in Westchester County, New York, where they spent the next 28 years, and were active members of the Sleepy Hollow Country Club in Scarborough. Connie had a strong interest in gourmet cookery. After her children were grown and gone, she pursued that interest as a post-graduate student at the Culinary Institute of America at Hyde Park, New York, and as the operator of a well-respected catering business for more than a dozen years. Connie and Ellis loved to travel. They made frequent trips with family and friends to western Europe, traveling extensively in France and northern Italy. In 2002, they retired to their vacation residence on St. Simon's Island, Georgia. Then, in 2008, they made a final move to San Rafael, California. Memorial services will be scheduled at a later date. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-06-16T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  MANNING, CONSTANCE"}, "snippet": "MANNING--Constance.
