The President and Trustees of Columbia University mourn the passing of William V. \"Bill\" Campbell, whose service to the University was profound, his impact beyond measure. Chair of the Board of Trustees from 2005 to 2014, Bill helped Columbia through one of the most dynamic eras in its history, which included the planning and groundbreaking of the new Manhattanville campus and the fulfillment of The Columbia Campaign - at that time, the largest single fundraising effort in Ivy League history. With a devotion to Columbia that stretched all the way back to his undergraduate years, when he captained the 1961 Ivy League Champion Lions, Bill was a trusted friend and energetic advocate for the University and its students, faculty, and alumni. A graduate of Columbia College and Teachers College, Bill was a loyal and passionate alumnus, and a driving force in the creation of the Columbia Alumni Association after he joined the University Trustees in 2003. Columbia continually benefitted from Bill's wisdom, judgment, and clear and optimistic vision for the University's future. He was a member of the Columbia College Annual Fund Steering Committee, co-chair of the Athletics Leadership Committee, and member of the Core to Commencement Campaign Steering Committee. Bill was devoted to the success of the athletics program as a whole, but was particularly invested in Columbia Football, and was the heart of the football alumni community. Not only was he proud of his experiences as a player at Columbia, but he also often talked about the lessons he learned as Columbia's head football coach from 1974 to 1979, en route to a successful career as an executive in Silicon Valley. In 2013, the University opened the Campbell Sports Center in his honor. The state-of-the-art facility fosters Columbia's spirit and transforms the student-athlete experience. The following year, the Athletics program retired his uniform number 67 for all 31 of Columbia's varsity teams. For his many contributions to Columbia, Bill also received the highest honors bestowed upon our alumni, including the Alexander Hamilton Medal and the John Jay Award. In 2015, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree and the Columbia Alumni Association Alumni Medal, which recognizes alumni for distinguished service of ten years or more. Bill's belief in Columbia University has inspired us for decades and the legacy he leaves will be felt for all time. Bill is survived by his son Jim Campbell and daughter Maggie Campbell; his wife Eileen Bocci Campbell and her children, Kevin, Matthew, and Kate Bocci; and his former wife, Roberta Campbell. To them and to the many he touched, Columbia University extends its deepest sympathies.
