Born in New Rochelle, New York, on January 15, 1928 to Grace and Ralph Tucker, she graduated from New Rochelle High School in 1945, and Smith College in 1949. In 1951, Janet married Stanley Ring Klion, to whom she was married for 43 years until his death in 1994. Together they raised three daughters in suburban Philadelphia, Boston, and New York. A lifetime bibliophile, Janet worked in publishing, volunteered at libraries and community bookstores, and donated hundreds of carefully chosen books to the community. A consummate newspaper and magazine reader, Janet provided her personal clipping expertise--aka Klion Klips--to friends and family. Janet was an avid tennis player, earning her the nickname \"Ace.\" She was an accomplished photographer, with a particular affinity for documenting athletes with disabilities. In 1992, she accompanied the US Paralympic Team to Barcelona as their photographer. Since 1996, Janet was active in Greenwich Library's Oral History Project, conducting dozens of interviews of community members and World War II veterans. She was a member of the Greenwich Daffodil Society, Holly Hill Tones chorus, several book groups, the Smith College Alumnae Club, and the Stamford Photography Club, where she met her partner of twenty years, Bob Weinberg. Janet was predeceased by her husband Stanley and her brother Ralph Tucker, Jr. She is survived by daughters Cathy, Emily, and Jenny Klion; sons-in-law Tom Plotz and George Brooks; grandchildren David, Joanna, Laelena, Toby, Misha, and Eve; and her partner Bob.
