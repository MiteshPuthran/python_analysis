Wilson, Jr., M.D., who made outstanding contributions to the hospital's growth, work and mission over five decades. He led Hospital for Special Surgery in advancing the field of joint replacement and orthopedic research, fostering the hospital's development as a worldclass center for patient care. As an educator and innovator of new techniques, Dr. Wilson introduced total hip replacement to the hospital in 1967, a new surgical procedure at the time. He went on to serve as the hospital's surgeon-in-chief from 1972 to 1989 and was recognized not only for his surgical skill, wisdom, integrity and sound judgment, but also for his compassion and thoughtfulness. His leadership and dedication helped transform Hospital for Special Surgery from an institution of local recognition to one of international acclaim. During his 17-year tenure as surgeon-in-chief, he developed a robust research department that brought together engineers and orthopedic surgeons and ushered biomechanics into the computer age. During this time, he held the dual role of Director of Resident Training, fostering innovation in graduate medical education and serving as a role model and inspiration for young, aspiring orthopedic surgeons. Dr. Wilson will be remembered as a leader in orthopedics, as an innovator, a mentor and a friend. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his entire family. Kendrick R.
