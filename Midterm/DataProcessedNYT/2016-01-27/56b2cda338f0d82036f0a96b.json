He was 98 years of age. George was born on April 23, 1917 in Brooklyn, New York, and attended both City College and Pratt Institute. George was an accomplished businessman, Chairman and CEO of National Die and Button Mould Company. He loved sports, including fishing, golfing, skiing and horse racing. And was a great comrade among his peers. He practiced hatha yoga, deep breathing and exercised throughout his life. He also enjoyed collecting art and adding to his collection-and loaned selected pieces to museums. He had a sense of humor and outstanding charm with elegance and wit. Everyone loved him-children, adults, friends and peers. His writings and his conversations were always enlightening to hear. He was a World War II veteran and fought in battles and campaigns, including Ardennes, Central Europe, Rhineland, Normandy, Northern France, and Belgium. Throughout his life he belonged to many clubs, including the Seawane Country Club and the Lone Star Boat Club. He was a religious man and a member of Central Synagogue. For over 70 years he designed and manufactured varieties of metal stampings-nailheads, studs, rhinestones and settings, metal and covered buttons, buckles, and other metal works. His customers included leaders in the fashion industry, automotive, aviation, and the United States Military. He loved people and could converse with anyone on any level-he would always light up a room. His time in World War II as a French interpreter and radar specialist in the anti-aircraft division, and his participation in the Battle of the Bulge and the invasion of Normandy left him with many great stories that he loved to share. These stories always interested everyone who met him. He is survived by his wife-Therese; sister-Hilda; four children-Jackson/Marina, Marvin/Victoria, Robert, Eileen; two stepchildren-Pamela/Jay, James/Ana; eight grandchildren-Lana/David, Ivy, Abigail, Cooper, Maria, Marella, Brian, Tod; and his loyal dog-Guy. George will be deeply missed. A service will be held at Frank E. Campbell on January 28th at 10am to celebrate his life and profound contribution. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-01-27T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  EISENPRESSER, GEORGE"}, "snippet": "EISENPRESSER--George, passed away on January 22, 2016, surrounded by his beloved wife, Therese, and son, Jackson.
