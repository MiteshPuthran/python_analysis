Born in Zurich, he moved to New York in 1940 with his parents and sister, where he grew up as an American teenager: attending high school in Manhattan; going to Summer Camp; and taking summer jobs as a delivery boy for Eclair. The family returned to Switzerland in 1944, yet the years in New York proved formative. American characteristics such as openness and drive melded with his European sensibility and warmth. Throughout his life he continued to spend long periods of time in the US - learning the textile business prior to joining his family's firm in the early 50's, attending Harvard University's AMP program in 1972, and as CEO of Phibro Energy Corporation and Executive Vice President of Salomon Brothers from 1986 to 1993, where he had joined in 1975. Preceded in death ten years ago by his beloved wife Jacqueline Weil-Bloch, he is survived by his children Corinne (Ofer), Denis, Nathalie (Shlomo) and Philippe (Orly), nine grandchildren, his sister Hermine Bader, his companion Marianne Lang and family and friends throughout the world. Donations in his memory may be made to AFIM, the American Friends of the Israel Museum. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-06-05T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  WEIL, ERNST"}, "snippet": "WEIL--Ernst, passed away peacefully at his home in Zurich on June 2, 2016 at the age of 86, surrounded by his family and loved ones.
