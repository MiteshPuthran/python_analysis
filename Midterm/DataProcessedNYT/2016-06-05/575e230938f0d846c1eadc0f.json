Her family, friends, their children, and her business, were the passions of her life. As a founder of First Editions Wallcoverings and Fabrics, Inc., in 1971, one of the first women owned businesses in the interior design industry, she was an inspiration to many. Dev's keen eye and unique sense of design brought originality and beauty to the interior design world, always nurturing artists and clients. Indomitable and inexhaustible, in January 2016 she began working on a sequel collection \"imagine the possibilities\" featuring new designs and technologies - her love of design a guiding force - that kept her moving forward. She is survived by her spouse Shelly Nudell, her partner in life and business for 45 years, her brother Jack Buxbaum and his wife Julie, a niece Joan Levine, nephew Joshua Tambor, sister's in law Bonita Buxbaum and Renee Tambor and her North Carolina family. She was predeceased by her loving sister Sarah Goldstein, brother Sidney Buxbaum and nephew David Buxbaum. Services were private. Contributions in Dev's name may be made to the charity of your choice. Dev will be remembered for her kindness and warmth, generosity, good humor, strength and her distinguishing \"red glasses\". We all have our memories of our witty, wise and wonderful Dev, and we will miss her greatly. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-06-05T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  BUXBAUM, DEVORAH (DEV)"}, "snippet": "BUXBAUM--Devorah (Dev), passed away on May 5th surrounded by family and loved ones.
