The fiery force that was Paulette Joy Douglas came into this world on March 18, 1950. Born to Helen and Hal in Philadelphia, PA, and raised in Bridgeton, NJ, with her brother Bobby, she graduated from Bridgeton High School in 1968. She had an endless passion for human rights and equality, and was involved in the major social movements of her time: she marched on Washington D.C., she burned her bras. After graduating from Temple University, Paulette embarked on an illustrious television career. She started as a makeup artist on the Mike Douglas Show, but quickly shifted into producing and directing. Paulette was a pioneer in this male- dominated field, and became one of the first female directors in news and sports. She was selected by the AFI's Directing Workshop for Women, for which she made her narrative directorial debut in the feature short The Couch, staring then-up-and-comer Julia Louis Dreyfus. Some of her greatest work was on the numerous featured specials which she produced and directed, including SITV's Vietnam: Long Time Coming, as well as countless productions during her tenure at Sports Illustrated Television. Her dynamic and compassionate work earned her five Emmys, and she left an everlasting impression on all the coworkers who bore witness to her intense passion and artistic vision. In 1987, Paulette married the love of her life, fellow television producer/director, Woody Freiman. Their union produced two daughters, Hannah and Halle Freiman, and one yellow lab, Yogurt. The couple raised their family on the Upper West Side of New York City. Her children were her pride, joy, and favorite source of anxiety. She adored her girls with a ferocious intensity, and she and Woody could not have been happier with the results of their two finest collaborations. In recent years Paulette focused on independent artistic endeavors, producing and directing two brilliant documentary features, The Peglegs of Stuyvesant High and The TEAM Makes a Play. She also continued her lifelong devotion to social justice and care for others: cooking dinners for a local homeless shelter, organizing a CSA, and journeying to Greece with Woody this past December to aid refugees fleeing Syria. In addition to her beloved brother, husband, and daughters, Paulette is survived by countless friends and family, including her half-brother Arthur, and cousins Pam Kaplow and Donald Douglass, who will miss her honesty, her fearlessness, her wisdom, her humor, her penchant for four-letter-words, her beauty, and her spirit. Losing her so soon and so suddenly was no one's plan, but Paulette never stuck to anyone's plan but her own. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-05-29T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  DOUGLAS, PAULETTE JOY"}, "snippet": "DOUGLAS--Paulette Joy.
