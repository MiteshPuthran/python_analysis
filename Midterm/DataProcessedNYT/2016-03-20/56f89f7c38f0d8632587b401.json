In the 1950s and early 1960s, Shirlene danced with the Metropolitan Opera Ballet and performed in musical theater. In 1956-57, she performed in the Broadway and national touring productions of the hit musical Fanny. In 1959, she played Jeanie Maclaren against Doretta Morrow's Fiona in a production of Brigadoon reviving the Broadway cast; her dance solo was widely praised in the press. She also played lead dance roles in several summer stock productions, including Carousel, Oklahoma and The King and I. Her TV credits included Firestone TV Theatre and The Jackie Gleason TV Show. She also modeled in print and TV ads for Revlon, Capezio, Helena Rubinstein and others. Her love of ballet began at age 12, when she participated in a free summer dance program in the city park on Coney Island. She received scholarships to continue her training, and began dancing professionally at age 17. She loved recounting the story of how a famous Broadway producer hand-picked her for Fanny at the first audition because she \"looked French\" in her all-black outfit. This allowed her to skip the voice auditions - a stroke of luck, because Shirlene just couldn't sing. Daughter of Joseph Gewirtz and Doris Levy Gewirtz, Shirlene grew up in Brooklyn and graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School. In 1958, she married Jay Richard Cohen of Cedarhurst, NY. The two were inseparable, pursuing numerous hobbies, including bird- watching, photography, tennis and golf, as well as ballroom and swing dancing. They danced together almost every night. Shirlene never stopped dancing. She did her ballet barre exercises every day throughout her life, and even in her late 70s was known to spontaneously perform the solo from Swan Lake on command. A devoted full-time mother, she was an energetic supporter of everything her four children did. She's survived by her husband Richard, their four children and their spouses/partners - Glenn Cohen (Rabbi Melinda Panken), Robin Cohen (Dan Russell), Guy Cohen (Luisa Tedoff Cohen) and June Cohen (Deron Triff) - as well as her brother Bernard Gewirtz and four grandchildren. Donations in her name are appreciated by the family and can be made to the National Dance Institute, which brings free dance programs to city kids: www.national dance.org/ support.htm 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-03-20T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  COHEN, SHIRLENE GEWIRTZ"}, "snippet": "COHEN--Shirlene Gewirtz, a ballerina who performed under the stage name Shirlene Starr, died of natural causes on February 25, 2016.
