The family and friends of Blanche Shapiro deeply mourn her passing, at the age of 106. Devoted wife of 80 years to her beloved husband and soul mate, Romie, Blanche was a woman of valor, an elegant and warm hostess, a widely admired and adored pillar of the Jewish community and an insightful, compassionate friend. In his memoirs, Romie called Blanche \"the sensitive, perfect lady,\" best described as a \"gute neshoma\" (\"a good soul\"). In 1910, Blanche, and her twin brother Michael, were born in London, England to Mr. and Mrs. Hyams. Blanche's family was widely known for its philanthropy in the London Jewish community, her mother among the early ardent Zionists.

Romie was President, Chairman and Chairman Emeritus and Blanche was an esteemed Member of its Board of Directors. The Blanche and Romie Shapiro Department of Fine Arts of the Bezalel Academy is an enduring tribute and legacy to an extraordinary couple. Together, Blanche and Romie were ardent philanthropists, patrons of the arts, and supporters of Jewish education. To know Blanche was to be inspired and feel welcomed. Her keen insights and observations were treasured by her many friends. She was passionately interested in the world around her; she followed politics closely, avidly followed Wimbledon, deeply cared about the world she was leaving to all children. Her generosity to her friends, both lifelong and new, was legendary. May the fullness of time allow our present sorrow to be eclipsed by wonderful memories of her life.
