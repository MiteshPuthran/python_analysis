Many who cherished Ciba's warmth, charm and intellect now treasure her memory. These include childhood friends from Great Neck, fellow Morris House 1964 Smith College graduates, and colleagues in the fields of publishing and crafts design. Ciba was a brilliant, creative artist who during her career played a major role in the late 20th century crafts renaissance particularly through her contributions to Better Homes and Gardens and Victoria magazines.
