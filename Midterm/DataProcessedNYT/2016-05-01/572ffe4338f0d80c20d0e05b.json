(Ionescu). Age 69, passed away March 24, 2016, with family at her bedside. Born August 6, 1946, in Targoviste, Romania, high school Valedictorian, graduate of the Bucharest Polytechnic Institute, M.E., 1969, worked for many years as Quality Control Engineer designing thermic and nuclear powerplants. She arrived in Michigan in 1991 with her young daughter, to reunite with her political refugee husband and young adult son. She worked as translator for Refugee Services, and later as Project Engineer at General Motors with her husband in the same Engine Design Powertrain group in Flint, Warren, and Pontiac, MI, retiring in 2004. She organized benefit concerts raising thousands of dollars when she heard of deep, unmet needs within the Romanian community. For the building fund of the Dormition Monastery in Rives Junction, MI, Ms. Miron took Mother Benedicta's mission as her own: to build a Romanian Orthodox Monastery on American soil. Later, she heard of the need for waterproof covers to protect the new mattresses donated by a foreign charity to the Tuicani Children's Orphanage. With the funds raised, she herself found and bought the right size covers for all the new mattresses, and sent them to Romania. She was truly loved, and she showed all who knew her what it meant to love: unconditionally, with fervor and passion, with fierceness and loyalty. Predeceased by her parents Emil and Ileana Miron (Sendrea), she is survived by her husband of 47 years, Ernest C. Ionescu, her children Alex (Mihaela) Ionescu and Marina Ionescu (Matthew) Heos, her granddaughter Julia Cristiana Heos, her sister Roxana Miron, cousin Mike Miron, M.D., and nephews Dragos Rosca, Mihnea Miron, and George Miron.
