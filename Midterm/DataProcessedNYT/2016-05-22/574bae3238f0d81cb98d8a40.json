She later received her MA from Fairfield University prior to starting her business as an independent educational consultant, which she ran for many years in Darien, CT. Dedicated to the field of education throughout her life, she founded the first English speaking school for the children of servicemen in Okinawa, Japan during her husband's deployment there in the late 1950's and was also instrumental in starting the First Presbyterian Nursery School in New Canaan, CT in the late 1960's. She was the President of the Connecticut College Alumni Association Board from 1974-1977; the College recognized her commitment by honoring her with the Agnes B. Leahy Award in 1980. After moving to Maine in the 1980's, her volunteer efforts included serving as a docent at the Tate House in Portland, a property of the Colonial Dames of America of which she was a member, and the South Freeport Congregational Church where she used her considerable cooking skills to bring meals and comfort to many who were ill or shut in.
