Susan Hope Slocum Hinerfeld, died April 30 in Santa Monica, CA, at age 79. She is survived by her husband of nearly 59 years, Robert Elliot Hinerfeld; two sons, Daniel Slocum (Laura Kleinhenz) and Matthew Ben (Nora Jaskowiak, MD); and five grandchildren, Sophie Rose, Eli Milton, Theo Jonathan, Willa Belle and Maude Hall. Susan was born in New York City, August 6, 1936, to Milton Jonathan Slocum, MD and Belle Esther Slocum (nee, Gibralter). Milton often walked Susan to the Calhoun School in the morning, quizzing her on Latin along the way. Susan graduated from Calhoun in 1953 and from Wellesley College in 1957. In 1959, Susan and Robert moved from Cambridge, MA to Los Angeles, where Susan worked for the public relations counselor Elaine K. Sewell Jones, wife of architect A. Quincy Jones. To get the job, Susan took a one-question exam: name the middle initial of the first director of the Museum of Modern Art. Susan instantly replied \"H,\" for Alfred H. Barr, Jr., and began a job and a lifelong friendship with the Joneses. Through them she became acquainted with Ray and Charles Eames and developed a love of design and modernist architecture. Decades later, Susan's son Matthew worked for Ray on her final book project. Susan was a great reader, an elegant writer and an exacting editor. She was co-author, with her father, of Manhattan Country Doctor, a best-selling memoir of Dr. Slocum's 34-year medical practice in Hell's Kitchen (Scribner's, 1986). Susan edited Wellesley After-Images (1974) and was a regular book reviewer for the Los Angeles Times. She often edited Robert's appellate briefs. Susan used her love of language, literature, design, art and architecture to teach her sons and their friends to be better writers, better observers, and more creative people. Many of them credit Susan's encouragement, instruction and editorial rigor with getting them into college and graduate school and helping them launch successful careers. Susan invested time and energy in the progressive schools her children attended, Westland and Crossroads. She had a wide circle of friends, young and old, and her home was a special gathering place where lives intersected, ideas and laughter flourished, and those in need found refuge. Susan was charming, stylish, nurturing, funny, brilliant, playful, selfless and kind. She was adored by all who knew her and loved dearly by her family. As a toddler, when Susan's parents asked her to do something against her wishes, she replied: \"Has I has to?\" That, Susan said in recent months, was her question about dying. A memorial is planned for the fall.
