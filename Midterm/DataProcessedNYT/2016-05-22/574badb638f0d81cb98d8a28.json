He excelled in golf and numerous racquet sports well into his adult years. Friends and family will remember Bob most especially for his infectious personality, dry wit, and kind-hearted nature. His balance of obvious intellect and distinct approachability facilitated enduring friendships and profound impressions on those within his personal and professional lives. He was loved by many and will be deeply missed by all. A memorial service to celebrate Bob's life will be held at 11am on Saturday, June 18 at St. Mark's Episcopal Church in New Canaan, CT.
