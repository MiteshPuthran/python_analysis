Professor Maccia no longer has an operative body through which his beautiful mind can express itself to us who are in a body. Born in 1920, he is the last of the children of Carmela Tosti and Salvatore Maccia who came from Italy and settled in New Jersey of America. He spent a large portion of his life as professor at Ohio State University and Indiana University at Bloomington teaching philosophy and research, so the legacy he leaves are his students and the extension of the thought of the great American Pragmatist Charles Sanders Peirce. Also, he was gifted artistically, musically and mechanically and so further enriched the lives of those he touched, particularly me, for I was his friend and lover since 1947. We were professors together at Ohio State University and Indiana University (even doing research and professional writing together). We traveled together (around the world twice) plus all our travels by land in our motor home (S.S. Grata), by air in our Cessna 182, and sea in our trawler, Chinita. We played together on the beaches of Florida (especially on the beach of Captiva Island where we lived the first ten years of our retirement); and we tangoed at The Italian American Club of Cape Coral. My love will continue.
