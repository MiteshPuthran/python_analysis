On May 18, 2016, Dr. C.G. (Balu) Balachandran, passed away in New York City, surrounded by his family. He was born in Kumbakonam, India, the youngest of five children. After obtaining his Ph.D. in physics from the IISc, his career as a physicist (acoustics) took him and his family to London, Wellington, Calgary and New York. Dr. Balachandran was a true renaissance man with diverse interests, but a passion for Carnatic music. He was an accomplished mridangist, accompanying many famous artists over the years, and with his wife of 55 years Usha, shared their love of music and dance wherever they lived. The passion he had for science and music were only surpassed by the love for his family. He is survived by his wife Usha, daughter Rama (Jayant), son Murali (Vijayagouri), two grandchildren Uma and Yuva, brother Pattabhiraman, and his beloved Max. Balu will be fondly remembered and missed.
