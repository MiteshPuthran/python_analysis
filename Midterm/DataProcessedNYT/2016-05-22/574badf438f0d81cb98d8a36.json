Al was a wise, supportive and diligent administrator. He was cherished by the staff in every school he worked. He never took a sick day! Al was an erudite man. He had many interests and hobbies that fulfilled his long life, including studying and investing in the stock market, collecting coins, playing chess and cards, gardening, painting, photography, classical music, opera, traveling. Al was a natural athlete. As a youngster, his baseball skills were good enough to earn him a tryout for a professional baseball team! He played tennis until he was 88! Al was a good natured, honest and gracious gentleman. He had a wonderful sense of humor and sharp memory that enabled him to recall and tell countless jokes at every occasion and at just the right time!
