Peter served as the First Deputy Mayor of the City from 1994 to 1996. He is widely credited with initiating and leading the reform of the City under the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. He was also Mayor Giuliani's campaign manager, most important political advisor, and life-long closest friend. Peter James Powers was born in Queens, NY on April 9, 1944 to Thomas and Florence Powers. Peter's dad was Delegate/Organizer for the Retail Clerks' Union. Although Peter came from a union background, he described himself and was a Goldwater Republican and a very proud one. Peter graduated from Bishop Loughlin Memorial High School in 1961, Manhattan College in 1965 and New York University Law School in 1968. He also earned an LL.M in taxation from N.Y.U. Law School and he was a Certified Public Accountant. He practiced tax law in New York City for many years before he began his involvement in politics. He was one of the foremost tax lawyers and had a thriving practice, when he left to take over Mayor Giuliani's 1989 run for Mayor at a time of real difficulties. He and Roger Ailes, then Mayor Giuliani's political consultant, are widely credited with guiding the campaign to a landslide victory in the Republican primary and, after beginning the general election run 29% behind, brought the campaign to within 2% of victory. Peter, this time teaming with David Garth, led Mayor Giuliani's campaign to a 2% victory in 1993. The victory was all the more remarkable because it was the largest percentage a Republican had received since Mayor LaGuardia. Peter's organization of a much more effective ground game is considered the difference that led to victory. After Peter Powers left City Hall he remained a close political advisor to Mayor Giuliani and his close friend and, later on, a very trusted business advisor. They handled a number of legal and business engagements together. Peter formed Powers Global Strategies. Through that company he and his partner -- later his wife -- Sylvia Ng, advised many multi-national corporations on government -relations matters. Peter was one of the most sought after consultants in the country. He also served on too many boards to list but, most notably, the boards of Fox Entertainment Group, Manhattan College, and Mutual of America Life Insurance, GFI Corporation, and the Partnership for New York City. He also served as Chairman and Director of Giuliani LLC and as Chairman of the New York City Public Initiatives Corporation. Mayor Giuliani said, \"Peter Powers is one of the main reasons New York City is such a great city today. Without him my administration could not have achieved the reforms and the Bloomberg administration could not have continued and improved on them. He was a great leader, my most important advisor and my friend for 58 years. Everyone in our city owes a debt of gratitude to Peter and today we lost a great American. Judith and I lost a beloved friend, and I lost a brother.\" Peter died surrounded by his wife Sylvia, who hadn't left his side during his six week hospitalization, and his loving family. He is survived by his wife, soul-mate, and business partner, Sylvia Ng, his daughters Heather McBride and Krista Harvey, daughters from his previous marriage to Kathleen Ingrassia, his grandchildren Eve, Catalina, Luke and Patrick, his sons-in-law, with whom he had a very close relationship, Scott McBride and Jeff Harvey and two older brothers Don and Jack. Friends may call at Frank E. Campbell, The Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street, NYC, NY on Saturday, July 9th and Sunday, July 10th, 2pm-5pm and 7pm-9pm. The Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated at St. Patrick's Cathedral on Monday, July 11 at 10 am.
