The Trustees and staff of myFace, formerly the National Foundation for Facial Reconstruction, and the staff and patients at the Wyss Department of Plastic Surgery at NYU Langone Medical Center mourn the passing of our friend and colleague, Whitney Burnett MacLeod. In her thirteen years as Executive Director of the foundation, she so generously provided her passion and energy to secure the success of our mission to provide comprehensive cutting edge surgical care and treatment to our patients with facial difference. The Foundation's activities grew enormously under her leadership. She directed a capital campaign that built a new administrative suite for the Foundation, a state of the art clinical facility to serve our patients and their families and the Bogert Plastic Surgery Learning Center. She also raised funds to establish two endowed professorships for the Wyss Department of Plastic Surgery. She truly epitomized the \"can do\" spirit. Whitney's warm smile and engaging personality drew supporters to our cause. Her kindness and generosity were boundless. She was a loyal and steadfast friend to everyone who knew her. Whitney will always remain in our hearts and in those of the thousands of patients whose lives were changed because of her efforts. We express our deepest sympathy to her children McCaleb Burnett, Philip Voss and Jeremy Voss. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-07-08T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  MACLEOD, WHITNEY BURNETT"}, "snippet": "MACLEOD--Whitney Burnett.
