The University of Michigan and its College of Engineering pay tribute to the life of esteemed graduate, John L. Tishman (BSE EE 1946; DEng Hon 2000) upon his passing. From the time he first stepped onto the field as manager of the 1945-1946 football team, until his death on February 6, 2016, he never wavered in his love of his alma mater. His counsel to deans and presidents; his leadership on the 55M Campaign during the 1960s, Capital Campaign Planning Committee in the 1970s and Honorary Chairmanship of the College's 150th Anniversary Campaign in the 2000s; his generosity of heart to staff and students-these were among his many contributions that spoke to the quality of character that was his hallmark. In 1998, the College was pleased to award John its highest distinction, the Alumni Society Medal, honoring the profound effect his leadership in construction management had on the construction industry. The University was proud to bestow upon him an honorary Doctor of Engineering degree in 2000 in recognition of his transformative contributions to construction management as well as his civic and philanthropic activities. Through the John L. Tishman Fellowship, John L. Tishman Professorship of Engineering, Tishman Hall and the Tishman Construction Management Program, his spirit will forever grace his University. The Michigan torch now passes to Dan, his son; Kate, his daughter; and his grandsons. We send our deepest sympathy to them and the rest of John's family. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-02-09T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  TISHMAN, JOHN L"}, "snippet": "TISHMAN--John L.
