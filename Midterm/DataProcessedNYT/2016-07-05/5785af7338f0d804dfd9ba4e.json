The Zamir Choral Foundation joins the world in mourning the passing of Elie Wiesel, our conscience, transmitter of memory, and a giant among men whose voice and legacy will remain an inspiration for generations to come. A consummate teacher and scholar, and a master of Hasidic song, our Honorary Chairman for a quarter of a century combined his love of music with his profound understanding of text, bringing both to the Heavenly spheres.
