Josephine Moll \"Molly\" Boeschenstein passed away peacefully Wednesday, December 30, 2015, in Hobe Sound, FL. Molly was born Josephine Hamlin Moll on October 29, 1930, in Detroit, MI, to Josephine Hamlin and The Honorable Lester Moll, a prominent Detroit prosecutor and judge. She grew up in Grosse Pointe, MI. In 1953, she married William W. Boeschenstein, who was working for Owens Corning in Detroit. The couple later moved to Perrysburg, Ohio, where they raised four sons. Mr. Boeschenstein ultimately became Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Owens Corning in Toledo, Ohio. Although her husband became the public face of the company, Molly was a genuine partner to him throughout his career. Molly was known for her intelligence, style, love of competition, and her outstanding, irreverent sense of humor. Conversations with her were punctuated by astute observations, humorous ripostes, and often times belly shaking laughter. She had a wide and deep circle of friends from every corner of her life. Molly was deeply involved in a number of civic and charitable organizations. Notably, she was the first President of the St. Vincent Medical Center Foundation in Toledo, OH, a committed volunteer at the Toledo Museum of Art, and a member of the Board of Directors of The National Council on Alcoholism and Addiction and The Freedom Institute in New York. Molly and her husband have made their principal residence in Hobe Sound, FL. She is survived by her husband of 62 years, William W. Boeschenstein, sons William Jr., Michael, Peter and Stephen, their spouses, and 10 grandchildren and one great- grandchild. Funeral services are pending.
