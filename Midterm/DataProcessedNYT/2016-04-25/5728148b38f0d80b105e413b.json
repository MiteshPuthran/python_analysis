To sum up the life of Bill Campbell, who died peacefully in his sleep this week with his family by his side, is a daunting and fundamentally impossible task - Bill's life and accomplishments were so vast and varied that even those who knew him best were only lucky enough to have witnessed a portion of them. Tributes to his astonishing legacy in Silicon Valley have already been pouring in, and rightly so. It is a legacy that is difficult to fathom. He had a hand in almost every consequential technology company of the past 30 years, either through direct relationship or through his coaching and mentoring of the company's key players, (and, in the case of Intuit, Claris, and Go, through his own tenure as CEO). From Apple to Google to Amazon to Twitter, from his mentorship of the iconic venture capitalists who helped shape the Valley to his under-the-radar involvement with legions of nerdy and unsexy companies barely known outside the tech community, but whose presences and innovations changed the technology landscape - Bill was always there, all smiles and hugs, his essence embedded in the company's DNA, pushing everyone involved to be better managers, more creative, and, most importantly, better people, to be the most authentic and truest versions of themselves. He is probably best known for being \"the Coach,\" a mentor to legends; as the legends themselves would be the first to tell you, he was so much more than the sum of those he advised. He was himself a legend. He was the legend. Bill was a man of beautiful and almost impossible contrasts. He was profane in a way that was unacceptable in many barrooms, let alone in church, and a devout Catholic who rarely missed Sunday Mass. A workaholic who pushed himself and those around him beyond their natural and professional limits, and a devoted husband and quite possibly the best father in history, who never, no matter what momentous occasion was on his schedule, missed an important event in his kids' lives. Famously honest and blunt (and sometimes even harsh), he would never hesitate to let you know when you were \"messing up\"; but when you were messing up, he'd be the guy who'd answer your call at all hours of the night and, with inspiring patience and empathy, talk you through whatever mistakes you had made and how you were supposed to rectify them. He preached teamwork and compassion and love. In many ways he seemed a throwback to a different era, a manly man, a jock's jock, gruff, aggressive, macho, old-fashioned, and yet he was comfortable and even thrived around dorks, dweebs, outcasts of all types- a \"nerd whisperer,\" as one journalist put it. His identity as \"the Coach\" was derived from both his general football-coaching demeanor and his time as an actual football coach, with all the good and bad that that particular stereotype entails; he was a passionate advocate for the advancement of women in Silicon Valley and for the LGBT community. He was never happier than at the annual 8th grade graduation at Sacred Heart Schools in Atherton, CA, when, year after year, a stream of students, boys and girls alike, would offer remembrances and speak movingly of by far their most meaningful experience at the school: getting the chance to play flag football for Coach Campbell, absorbing the lessons he taught them, lessons that were, perhaps not surprisingly, essentially identical to the lessons Coach had imparted to those he'd coached in the adult world. Teamwork. Structure. Integrity. Accountability. Passion. Hard work. Empathy. Love. Traits he'd learned growing up in Homestead, PA, where he would end up donating millions of dollars to education and youth projects. A final common refrain about Bill: Everyone who knew Bill thought of him as their best friend. Bill was a people person. He oozed charisma. When he talked to you he made you feel like you were the only person that mattered. It might be tempting for those who didn't know Bill that well to conclude that all this was just some act. How could one person be so overflowing with joy, with the amount of joy and love requisite for connection with such a staggering number of people on such a profound level - Obviously it had to be an act. It wasn't. He really did love people the way they loved him. New friends were made wherever he went. Often they were baristas, waiters, and, let's face it, bartenders, people who didn't know initially who he was and in some cases never would. He had friends in high and low places and everywhere in between. It was infectious. He was a uniter, he imparted his worldview onto his friends and mixed his groups of friends together, so that friends in California became close with friends from Homestead and New York and elsewhere; wealthy friends grew to love friends who were less well off and vice versa; tech friends, academic friends, and football friends were molded into one great big Bill Campbell group. Bill Campbell never saw wealth or social status or anything artificial when judging the merits of people. He sought in others the same qualities he himself so fully embodied. Bill's friends, and there were many, by definition embodied his values; he wouldn't have been friends with them if they hadn't. Bill Campbell really did believe that everyone who lived by his values, friend or not, was fundamentally the same, of equal goodness, of equal worth. On this last point, sadly, he was somewhat mistaken. Indeed when you get down to it most people are essentially the same, most of their differences are artificial. But Bill Campbell was better than everyone. And all of his friends are infinitely better off for having known him. William Vincent Campbell Jr., who was born August 31, 1940 in Homestead, PA and who died April 18, 2016 in Palo Alto, CA, is survived by his wife Eileen Bocci Campbell, his two children Jim and Maggie, and his three step children Kevin, Matthew, and Kate Bocci. A Funeral Mass will be held Monday, April 25th at Sacred Heart Preparatory in Atherton, CA at 11am. In lieu of flowers, the family, per Bill's wishes, requests that donations be made to the American Cancer Society, or, for the benefit of the community of Homestead, PA, to the Campbell Education and Community Foundation.
