The Cantors Assembly, with profound sadness, notes the passing of its beloved past president, Hazzan Kurt Silbermann.

Once Hebrew Union College opened its cantorial school in New York, Kurt auditioned and was accepted into its first class. Possessing a most beautiful baritone voice, he served Temple Emanu-El of Englewood, NJ, for over 30 years, many of them alongside side noted rabbi, Arthur Hertzberg.
