Timmy started his comedy career in Houston before moving to New York City. He was a beloved performer at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre and traveled the country with the UCB TourCo. Timmy appeared on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!,\" Funny or Die, Improv Everywhere, Fusion, and in countless UCB Comedy videos. Timmy loved Halloween and telling spooky stories around the campfire, so his family and friends are absolutely positive that Timmy Wood is now a ghost. Timmy Wood The Ghost's chief unfinished business will be to watch over his wife, Julie, who once swore that she and Timmy would never, ever date. They recently celebrated five years of marriage and the only blemish on their relationship was a rather lackluster performance on television's \"The Newlywed Game.\" Timmy Wood The Ghost will also be joining his father, Jim, in looking after his mother, Terianne, his sister, Rebekah, and his brother, John. Even in the afterlife, Timmy Wood The Ghost will lovingly tend to his pet candles Howie Candel and LeBron Flames. (\"Candles are the new pets.\") Timmy Wood The Ghost's spooky spirit will always be felt at the UCB Theatre. It is said that if you listen closely after late Thursday night shows, you can still hear him uttering his annual comedy catchphrases, including \"Suck it down, Charlie Brown,\" \"Uhhhhhhhhhh... check please!\" \"HOLD THE SLAW,\" and \"DAH FOOK?!?\" Even in death, Timmy Wood The Ghost still stands by his controversial, nearly career- ending 2015 catchphrase \"I'll have one more picky for my ticky.\" Now that he has shuffled off this mortal coil (Shakespeare, baby!), Timmy Wood The Ghost will have more time to tinker with his comprehensive ranking of Bond movie theme songs, create insane games with made-up rules that only he can understand, finally watch a regular season Houston Rockets game, research Illuminati conspiracy theories on the internet, defend \"Yeezus\" as his favorite Kanye West album, and drink Shinerbock in one of his many New York City \"secret spots.\" Timmy will be missed dearly. And even though it was far too short, his time in this realm gets a perfect five out of five big, beautiful, man-beards. In lieu of flowers, Timmy's family asks that anyone wishing to celebrate his life of seemingly boundless love and positivity contribute to The Timmy Wood Comedy Memorial Fund at gofundme.com/timmywood. As always, everyone who donates gets one high-five. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-05-19T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  WOOD, TIMMY"}, "snippet": "WOOD--Timmy, a comedian, writer, one-time Ralph Lauren Model, and New York City's resident \"Man of Mirth,\" passed away on Saturday, May 14th in his home in Brooklyn, New York at the age of 32.
