Born in Manhattan on April 15, 1927, the daughter of Jacob M. and Mildred L. Simon, Teddy was the devoted wife for 62 years of her beloved late husband Robert. She is survived by their three children, Roger, William and Margot; five grandchildren, Olivia, Aliza, Ariela, Emma and Iris; and one great- grandchild, Lucie. She was a graduate of The Dalton School and, in 1947, of Vassar College, where she was editor-in-chief of the Vassar Miscellany News and a lifelong active alumna. Teddy's leadership in raising funds for a Class of 1947 entrance hallway to Vassar's Main Library is a testament to her dedication to Vassar and her ability to motivate classmates to make a significant gift to their alma mater. She was a member of the latter-1940s news staff of Time, Inc. Ardent in her appreciation of fine arts, Teddy pursued graduate studies in art history at NYU and photography at International Center of Photography during the 1970s. She became an art dealer and appraiser, working with individual and corporate clients in New York, New Jersey and Eastern Long Island. She was a member of the Cosmopolitan Club of Manhattan and an avid supporter of major arts institutions in the New York metropolitan area and the Hamptons. With her searching intelligence, wit and insight, she was an indispensable partner in the success her husband Robert enjoyed in his professional life, an inspiration to her children and grandchildren to aspire to excellence in all they do, and a beacon of grace and light in friendships that lasted decades. Her ashes will be buried at sea. Contributions in her memory may be made to Vassar College, or to Guild Hall of East Hampton, NY. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-01-17T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  GREENBAUM, THEODORA SIMON"}, "snippet": "GREENBAUM--Theodora Simon, of New York and East Hampton, died peacefully at home, December 22nd, age 88.
