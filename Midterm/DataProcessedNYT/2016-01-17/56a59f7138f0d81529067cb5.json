Avery was born on June 18, 1939 in Baltimore, Maryland. She moved to France after graduating from Trinity College to attend law school in Nice, and despite being a newcomer to the language, graduated at the top of her class. Avery (aka maitre Glize) served the Cote d'Azur for more than forty years as a bilingual French lawyer. She founded the Riviera Council of the U.S. Navy League and later served as Honorary Consulate of the United States in Nice. Avery counted hundreds of friends in the US Navy, from five star Admirals down to fledgling sailors, and too many friends on the Riviera to count. We will all miss her terribly. She is survived by her loving daughter, Dr. Ferney Santini and husband, Jean-Jacques Santini, two adored grandchildren, Jean-Yves and Lauren Santini and three brothers, James Gregory Kane, Michael Kane and Steven Renehan.
