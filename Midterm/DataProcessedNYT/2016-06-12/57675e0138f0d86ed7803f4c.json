The 3rd Musketeer of Faulkner, Dawkins & Sullivan now is gone! And with him goes another part of my life and the lives of many others who lived with or worked for him over the years. In 1955, I joined a predecessor company... Laurence M. Marks & Company... that was located at 48 Wall Street. Dwight/ Dick/ and John were there and all of us remained with that renowned investment research firm until 1959 when the surviving partners of Mr. Marks' company elected to be acquired by a West Coast retail brokerage house: Dean Witter. It was thus that Faulkner, Dawkins & Sullivan was created and the firm prospered through the 1960's and early 1970's. FD&S was acquired by Sandy Weill's Shearson Co. in 1977... at something less than 1/2 of Book Value. Three years later, American Express bought Shearson at a significant premium. Subsequently, John created an asset management firm... SuIlivan Morrissey & Mickle... that existed through the date of his passing on 23 May 2016. Even though we all had taken separate paths some time during the 1970's-1980's, I know that John continued to be respected by all in the investment community who knew and/or had worked with him. For those who built careers on Wall Street from the 1950's onward, \"the wagons once again have circled ever closer.\" Nevertheless, John F. Sullivan will live on in all of our memories. Robert P.
