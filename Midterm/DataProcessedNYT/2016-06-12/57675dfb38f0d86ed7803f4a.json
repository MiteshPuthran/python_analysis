Born in Newark, NJ, he was married to wife Dee for 59 loving years. After his freshman year at Rutgers in 1941, Art enlisted in the U.S. Navy and volunteered for a special naval warfare unit known as the Beach Jumpers. Commanded by the actor Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., they were trained in the military art of deception, diversion and psychological warfare. A few dozen men in specially equipped air-sea rescue boats could fool the enemy into believing they were being attacked by a 70,000 man amphibious landing force. These units raised hell with German coastal defenses throughout the Mediterranean and kept the enemy off-balance while the Allies carried out the invasions of Italy and southern France. Arthur was one of the last surviving members. After the war, he graduated from George Washington University with a BA in Business and joined his father and brother Herb in the dry cleaning business. He spent 20 years building Bond Cleaners, which serviced a large portion of New Jersey. Arthur left the business in the 1960's to earn an MA in Human Relations from NYU. In 1971, while continuing his Ph.D studies, he became a Financial Officer at Essex County College and devoted the next 37 years to enhancing the reputation of this educational institution in downtown Newark. He served in a number of other capacities: Associate Professor-Social Sciences Division, Director of Counseling and Advisement, counselor in the Business Division, before retiring at age 83. Arthur was a role model and inspiring mentor to students, faculty and administrators. He also maintained a psychotherapy practice in NYC. Arthur was the first to offer a helping hand and had a kind word for everyone. All who knew and loved him benefited from his warm heart, humorous spirit and generous nature. He is deeply missed. Arthur is survived by his sister Sandra Bernstein, daughters Susan and Karen and son Gary, seven grandchildren and sons-in-law Jay Coggeshall and David Ryugo. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-06-12T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  HENOCH, ARTHUR SAUL"}, "snippet": "HENOCH--Arthur Saul, 90 years old, died peacefully at his home in New York City on January 22, 2016.
