One year ago today, artist Nela Arias-Misson passed away quietly in Miami, FL, a few weeks short of her 100th birthday. Born in Cuba, she studied art at the Student Arts League of New York. In the late 1950's, she moved to Provincetown to study with Hans Hofmann, the dean of abstract expressionism. She moved to Ibiza in 1961 and developed her own style. Always at the epicenter of developing artistic movements, she was close with Mark Rothko, Karel Appel, Walasse Ting and Antoni Tapies amongst others. She lived in Barcelona, Madrid and Brussels, where she was greatly influenced by visual poets like Paul DeVree, Joan Brossa, and her ex-husband, the poet Alain Arias-Misson. Although Nela lived to paint, the discovery of her genius by the contemporary art world is taking place after her passing, when many other women in her same era are being recognized. She is survived by her daughter, Carole Bird. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-07-17T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Memorials  ARIAS, MISSON, NELA"}, "snippet": "ARIAS-MISSON--Nela.
