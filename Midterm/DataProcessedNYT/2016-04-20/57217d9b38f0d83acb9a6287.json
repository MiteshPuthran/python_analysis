He was 87. The cause was complications brought on by cancer of the kidney. Mr. Torricini spent over 50 years in the design world, firstly in the ateliers of Paris, before arriving in New York City in the late 1950's being sponsored by the dance choreographer, Jerome Robbins. Starting in the garment district on Manhattan's west side cutting patterns, it wasn't long before he was able to open his own boutique on East 63rd Street specializing in ladies millinery and accessories. With his effervescent personality and helpful promotion from friends, including the renowned duo pianists Arthur Gold and Robert Fizdale, he was soon producing works for many of Manhattan's elite. His keen eye for color as well as a great sense of the dramatic soon spilled over into the world of interior design, where he was asked to assist his many friends with their own homes which he did with great style. This transition into interior design soon led him to him to several extended stints on cruise ships where he designed interiors on boats of Dutch, Greek and Italian registry over a ten year period. His later years were spent mostly seeking works of art for his own homes in Manhattan, Sag Harbor and Florida. Angelo Rene Torricini was born in Fort-de-France, Martinique on December 14, 1928 to Paul Jean and Marie Josephine Torricini, where his father was stationed with the French military. His father's career included postings in many exotic locations influencing both Mr. Torricini and his sculptor sister Claude with their own aesthetic. He was predeceased by his wife Katherine Stainton Torricini and a brother Robert. He is survived by his dear friend Jerome Jacalone, sister Claude Torricini and her husband Michel Moritz of Paris, a niece Marilyn, a cousin Sandra and a sister-in-law Eveline.
