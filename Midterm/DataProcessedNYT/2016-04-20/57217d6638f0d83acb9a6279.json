Harry Frank Upton liked to tell a story about how he joined the U.S. Air Force. On a brisk autumn morning in 1949, Harry lined up with his ROTC unit. Each man counted off, the ones matched with the nation's newly-formed Air Force, the twos stayed in the Army. Harry counted off one, and went on to serve proudly as a jet pilot from 1953 to 1956, attaining the rank of Captain. Harry counted life itself a blessing. He skied into his eighties, and took long walks until cancer took his strength earlier this year. He perished in the midst of outlining a book, on how to be active and joyful after eighty. Harry felt he had glimpsed a few secrets to life, and sought to share them widely. Harry was 84 when he passed away, on Saturday, March 12, 2016 in Stamford, CT. He was a resident of Bondville, VT and Darien, CT. Born on July 1, 1931 in Carroll, IA, he was the son of the late Harry and Frances Talcott Upton. He received a B.S. degree from Iowa State University and a M.B.A. from Stanford University. Harry had a distinguished career in business. In 1958 he joined Proctor & Gamble in product management. He went on to join Abbott Labs, where he rose to become president of the consumer products division. Later, he started his own firm, and then founded Care Technologies, where he was granted two patents. After retiring in 2004, Harry invested his time in the community as a volunteer and board member. Throughout his life he unwaveringly greeted friends and colleagues with a firm handshake. Harry is survived by his wife Peggy Upton and three children, Elise Upton Young of Darien; Brett Upton of Rutland, VT; Matt Upton of Denver, CO. His eyes twinkled when he spent time with his four grandchildren Ryann Price, David Young, Meriel Upton, and Mac Upton. He was predeceased by his siblings Robert Upton, Donald Upton, and Marge Doty. A Memorial Service open to all will be held at Talmadge Hill Memorial Church in Darien, CT at 4pm on Saturday, April 30.
