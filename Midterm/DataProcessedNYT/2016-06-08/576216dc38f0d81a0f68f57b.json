She was 69. Pamela is survived by her husband, Edward White, her brother Chum Steele, her children Banker White, Devon White Angelini, and Luke White, her grandchildren Leif, Elin, Dylan, Edward, Oscar, and dozens of well-earned friends. Pamela was born in Boston, and had a self-described \"fairy tale\" childhood. She was raised in the Hotel Continental in Harvard Square which was owned and managed by her father, Chauncey Steele. She often posed for paintings for her mother, renowned artist Marian Steele. Pam shared her fairy tale charm and optimism throughout her remarkable life. Pam was a unique, vibrant spirit who was loved by all who knew her. She had many careers: a professional model, a teacher for the developmentally delayed, a social worker and health counselor at Milton Academy, and a therapist in private practice. She co-founded a Boston area a cappella group, The Second Wind, which is in its 43rd consecutive year performing. She was a trusted ally and feared opponent on the tennis court, and an exemplar sportswoman. Even her battle with Alzheimer's disease was transformed into a work of art in \"The Genius of Marian,\" a feature length documentary directed by her son Banker White and his wife Anna Fitch. Above all else, she loved her family, was fiercely loyal, and made everyone around her feel heard, loved, and lucky to have known her. A memorial service will be held on Friday, June 10th at 12pm at the Church of the Redeemer in Chestnut Hill. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the Pamela Steele White Family Foundation, c/o Lynch Brewer Hoffman & Fink, 75 Federal St., 7th Floor, Boston, MA 02110. The foundation will fund scholarships to deserving students in the Boston Area, among Pamela's other charitable interests. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-06-08T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  WHITE, PAMELA STEELE"}, "snippet": "WHITE--Pamela Steele, gifted therapist and beloved mother, wife, and friend, died June 6, 2016.
