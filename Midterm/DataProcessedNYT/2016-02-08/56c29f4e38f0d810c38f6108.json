Constance \"Connie\" Trapp MacCrate, long time resident of Plandome, Long Island, New York, passed away on January 21, 2016 at the age of 95. Beloved wife of Robert; sister to Harry, Virginia, and Jackie; mother to Christopher, Barbara and Thomas; mother-in-law to Kari, Chuck, and Claire; grandmother to Ryan, Kyle, Samantha, Matthew, Elisa, Kristia, Danielle, Caitlin, Juliet, and Isobel, and great grandmother to Brandon, Charlotte, Maverick, Daemon, Wade, and Aurora. She was the guiding light of the MacCrate family. Born in Laconia, New Hampshire in 1920 to Judge Harry Trapp and Florence McGloughlin Trapp, she lived her life as a true New Hampshirite, following the state motto: Live Free or Die, and taught by example humility, kindness, and resolve (some say stubbornness) to all who met her. Devoted to children and education, she volunteered for many years at Shelter Rock School, taught Sunday school at the Congregational Church of Manhasset, and never missed a game or recital or anything else her kids participated in, always offering her unfaltering support. She was a true constant in her family's lives. Connie matriculated from Mount Holyoke College in 1942, went on to work at Harvard Business School, and met her husband, Robert MacCrate, while he was attending Harvard Law School. They were married on May 4,1946 in Laconia, New Hampshire, and spent the next 69 years together, until her passing with Robert at her side. She was remembered privately by the family. Those who would like to share in her remembrance may send memorial gifts to The Legal Aid Society of New York (www.donate.legal-aid.org); questions regarding these gifts may be directed to Connie's granddaughter Caitlin MacCrate (cjmaccrate@ gmail.com), who is running the New York City Half Marathon to benefit the Legal Aid Society in her grandmother's honor. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-02-08T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  MACCRATE, CONSTANCE"}, "snippet": "MacCRATE--Constance.
