He returned to his beloved Yale University in 1992, serving as Dean of the School of Management and, subsequently, as Williams Brothers Professor of Management and Public Policy. In reporting Professor MacAvoy's passing, Yale School of Management professor, Sharon Oster, wrote, \"In his economics work and in his life outside of the academy, Paul was committed to the idea of public service and to the view that economic thinking and evidence could and should be used to improve society. Paul was demanding of his students and devoted to them, drawing several of them into his considerable research operation and following and helping their careers over many years.\" During the course of his illustrious career, Professor MacAvoy served on President Gerald Ford's Council of Economic Advisors and as co-chairman of the President's Task Force on Regulatory Reform. He also served on the Boards of Directors of the Chase Manhattan Bank, the Alumax Corporation, AMAX Gold Incorporated, the American Cyanamid Corporation, the Lafarge Corporation, Colt Industries, and Combustion Engineering. Professor MacAvoy was an expert on federal regulation of industry and energy and authored more than 30 books and journal articles including \"The Unsustainable Cost of Partial Deregulation\" (Yale University Press, 2007) and \"The Failure of Antitrust and Regulation to Establish Competition in Long-Distance Telephone Services\" (The MIT Press, 1996). From his time as an undersized guard for the Haverhill High School Hillies football team, his service to his country on the Council of Economic Advisors, his stewardship of the William E. Simon School and the Yale School of Management, to his ultimate position as family patriarch and beloved grandfather, Paul always \"gave it his best\" and encouraged those around him to do the same. A wise, kind and gentle man, Professor MacAvoy's wit, wisdom, kindness and generosity will be sadly missed. A private celebration of his life will be held in Woodstock, Vermont in June. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-03-06T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  MACAVOY, PAUL W"}, "snippet": "MacAVOY--Paul W.
