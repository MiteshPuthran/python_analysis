Alan started making documentary films in the late 60s supporting the Civil Rights, Anti-War, and Feminist Movements. He was directly involved in the emerging wave of independent film and video as a founding member of Newsreel, co-owner of Odeon Films, and Executive Director of the Association of Independent Video and Filmmakers.

In Los Angeles, he produced narrative television films for The Film Foundry, his own production company, and others including Mirage Enterprises, CBS, and Hallmark Hall of Fame.
