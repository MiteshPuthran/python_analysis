The cherished daughter of Paula Firestone Ranow, Edna was the treasured wife of Maurice Jerome Hoffman of Bridgeport, whom she married on September 15, 1940, after her graduation from Vassar College. Edna and Maury, who lived their magnificent lives in Bridgeport and Fairfield, were perfect co-partners and co-paragons for 54 loving years, until Maury's death in 1995. We, Edna's children -- Elisabeth (Alan) Doft, Constance (Yves) de Balmann, Laurence Hoffman, and Bruce Hoffman, plus eight grandchildren -- Michael Doft, Jonathan Doft (Dr. Melissa), Rachel Doft (John Wareck), Raphael de Balmann (Courtney), Gabriel de Balmann, Paul Hoffman, Andrew Hoffman, Daniel Hoffman, plus five great-grandchildren -- Andrew and Alexander Doft, Eliza Wareck, Alexander and Natalie de Balmann -- have lost our mother's glowing presence, but we will never lose our memories of her unending kindness, selfless generosity, incisive intellect, and enthusiastic joie de vivre. Immersed in life-long learning and culture, she was equally committed to \"repairing the world.\" Always contributing, effective, high-minded, and principled, she had a seriousness of purpose combined with an innate grace and lightness of touch which made her totally irresistible. She was the star that lit up our firmament, and she has left a stellar legacy for us all. Her life was -- and her memory will always remain -- an undying blessing. The funeral will be at 11am on Wednesday, May 25th, at Congregation Rodeph Sholom, 2385 Park Ave., Bridgeport, CT 06604.
