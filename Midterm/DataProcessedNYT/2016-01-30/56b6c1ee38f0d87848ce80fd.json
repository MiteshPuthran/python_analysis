NYU Lutheran's board and staff are deeply saddened by the passing of chair emeritus Howard Smith. As chairman of Lutheran Medical Center and Augustana Center from 1966 until 2004, Smith, who died Thursday at age 85, left an indelible legacy on southwest Brooklyn. With his friend New York City Mayor John Lindsay and the American Lutheran Church, Mr. Smith brokered the 1977 expansion and relocation of Lutheran Medical Center from 4th Avenue and 46th Street to its present location, a former warehouse at 55th Street and 2nd Avenue in Sunset Park. He facilitated the creation of the Sunset Park Family Health Center, now called NYU Lutheran Family Health Centers, the second largest federally qualified health center network in the nation. He created a lasting financial foundation for Lutheran through Health Plus, an innovative government-sponsored insurance program for low-income residents. Lutheran's sale of Health Plus to Amerigroup in 2011 created an endowment that continues to help modernize the health system. Mr. Smith, a lifelong Brooklyn resident, was chairman emeritus of the United Hospital Fund, former president of the Brooklyn Public Library Board of Trustees, and past vice president and director of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Smith received a bachelor's in chemical engineering from Princeton University and served in the U.S. Army. He served 40 years as president of Virginia Dare Extract Company, which was founded by his grandfather Bernard, and was a former director of Dime Savings Bank of New York before it merged with Washington Mutual in 2002. He is predeceased by his wife, Elsie, and survived by his three children, Howard Jr., Jean, and Lilla, and grandchildren. NYU Lutheran mourns as we celebrate Mr. Smith's life and legacy. A wake will be held at Clavin Funeral Home, 7722 4th Ave., Brooklyn, on Tuesday, February 2, at 4-8pm. Services will be held at the Lutheran Church of the Good Shepherd, 7420 4th Ave., Brooklyn, on Wednesday, February 3, at 10 am. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-01-30T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  SMITH, HOWARD"}, "snippet": "SMITH--Howard.
