The trustees and staff of the United States - Japan Foundation note with deep sadness the passing of our beloved founder, Robin Chandler Duke, on February 6. Ambassador Duke understood in 1980 that Japan and the United States were moving into an era of unnecessary friction over trade and other issues, friction that threatened our alliance. With characteristic energy and vision, she approached Mr. Ryoichi Sasakawa, a Japanese philanthropist, and persuaded him to make a generous contribution of $45 million to endow what has become today the US-Japan Foundation in New York. In the past 35 years this foundation has donated more than $90 million to our core programs, enhancing K-12 education in each country about the other, bringing young leaders from both nations together into lasting networks of communication and friendship, and more recently, strengthening the role of women in both nations. Robin Duke played a critical role in building a strong board of trustees, infusing the board and staff with her dynamism and practical knowledge of international affairs, and her strong conviction that Japan and the U.S. share the same values. Her legacy will last well into the future. We miss her vibrant presence. James Lintott, Chairman of the Board; George R.
