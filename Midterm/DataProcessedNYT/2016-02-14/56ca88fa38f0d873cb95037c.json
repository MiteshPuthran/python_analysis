Born in Chicago, IL, February 9, 1919, he lived in Manhattan since 1950. A decorated Army Veteran of more than four years without home leave during World War II, including the Normandy invasion and the Battle of the Bulge, he rose to the rank of Sergeant in an artillery division under General Patton. Upon return to the United States, he studied at the University of Chicago and finished with a Master of Fine Arts degree from the Art Institute of Chicago. Beginning in 1955, he was an artist in the Division of Vertebrate Paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History. There, he supported the research of curators and scientists for more than 60 years. He was an extraordinary artist and scientific illustrator and a consummate teacher of photography and illustration to generations of students. His work improved the quality and impact of their publications immensely. Before the existence of computerized fossil images, he developed new techniques for the photographic representation of skeletal material brought from the field by paleontologists. He traveled and painted in France, enjoyed tennis and Classical music, and read widely in the fields of art, history, and philosophy. He needed little more than suggestion to engage in hours of conversation over wine and good cheese. Along with close staff friends and colleagues at the AMNH, Chester is survived by three nephews and several great- nieces and nephews in the greater Chicago area and in Colorado, and cousins in New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts. He was buried with military honors in a private ceremony Tuesday, October 13 at the Gerald B.H. Solomon Saratoga National Cemetery in Schuylerville, NY. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-02-14T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  TARKA, CHESTER S."}, "snippet": "TARKA--Chester S.,passed away with loving hospice care on October 7, 2015, after a brief hospitalization.
