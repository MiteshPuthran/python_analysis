(HAI) for over 40 years, passed away on November 30, 2015 in New York City at the age of 77 due to complications arising from pneumonia. He is survived by his daughter, Joanna Spencer; granddaughter Katherine \"Katie\" MacAaron; sister Caryle Wells; son-in-law David MacAaron; brother-in-law Arthur Wells; nephew Andrew Wells; many cousins; and numerous pets including dogs, cats, horses, goats and chickens. He was the son of Joseph and Ethel Spencer. Michael was born on Valentine's Day, 1938, in Brooklyn, NY. He spent his formative years in Los Angeles, CA, where he attended Fairfax High School, and became friends with schoolmate Phil Spector. Later, he became a sessions pianist as well as music contractor for Spector. His playing can be heard on the original classics \"Be My Baby\" and \"Pretty Little Angel Eyes.\" In his youth he also studied classical piano with Serge Tarnowsky, who had been Vladimir Horowitz's teacher. As a teenager, he and another friend found Bela Lugosi listed in the telephone book, which began a friendship with the actor famed for portraying Dracula, that culminated in Michael being a pallbearer at Lugosi's funeral. Michael graduated Phi Beta Kappa from UCLA with a degree in Economics, then moved back to the East Coast to attend Harvard Law School. However, he chose to leave after three months to resume piano studies, at Mannes College of Music in New York City. Soon after, he married fellow Mannes student Ruth Albert. Over the next few years, Michael gave many weekly performances for patients in long term, chronic psychiatric hospitals around New York City. It was during this period that he attended a Ravi Shankar concert at a huge hall with only a handful of people in attendance. He realized that he could have filled the empty seats in the hall with very appreciative patients from the hospitals nearby where he performed regularly. He began requesting free, unused tickets, bringing his first busload of 200 patients to a Senior Musicians Orchestra concert in 1967. It was this event that shaped his destiny and Michael decided that he would dedicate his life to patients in hospitals, uplifting their lives and bringing them out of their grim existences. Working from his dining room table, he began his quest for funding, operating on a \"never take no for an answer\" and \"it's now or never\" approach. In 1969, Hospital Audiences Inc. (HAI) was incorporated. The organization grew, expanded and flourished over the years, reaching over 14 million people, in a wide variety of programs. In addition to serving the original hospital clientele, HAI consumers grew to include underserved populations such as residents in homeless shelters, at-risk youth, adults in rehab programs, frail elderly, the incarcerated, and the physically and mentally challenged. Decades ago, Michael described his work as bringing \"chicken soup to the soul.\" Under his guidance, and by always thinking out of the box, exceptional things happened, such as transporting patients on gurneys to cultural events on the HAI buses which he helped design, or bringing wounded soldiers from Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, DC to NYC for a weekend of cultural and special events. He was the recipient of many awards, among them an Honorary Doctorate from Hobart-William Smith College, and numerous awards from the City and State of New York. Michael was a passionate musician, playing his Bechstein piano for hours daily, and choosing to celebrate his 75th birthday in Slovakia with his daughter Joanna, playing the Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto #", "pub_date": "2016-02-14T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  SPENCER, MICHAEL JON"}, "snippet": "SPENCER--Michael Jon, Founder and Executive Director of Hospital Audiences, Inc.
