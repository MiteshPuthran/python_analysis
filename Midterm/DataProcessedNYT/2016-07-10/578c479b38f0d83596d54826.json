He married Simona Schor on December 26, 1951 and the couple had two children, Dodis and Darius. After many years of living under Communist rule, Dr. Kohan and his family left Romania to begin life in the United States. Having practiced medicine in Romania, Dr. Kohan was accepted to New York University Medical Center for a residency program in obstetrics and gynecology. After completing his residency program, Dr. Kohan began working in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at New York University Medical Center where he became a full professor. Dr. Kohan is accredited with bringing the colposcopy procedure, identifying the size and location of suspicious lesions through a magnifier to prevent cervical cancer, to New York University Medical Center more than 40 years ago. Dr. Kohan was a proud member of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology for many years. He retired at the age of 80 years old. The epitome of a doting grandfather, Dr. Kohan had the pleasure of seeing his three granddaughters, Jaqueline, Lauren, and Corinne, graduate from college. His greatest joy was spoiling these three special girls. The proud father of two physicians, Dr. Kohan enjoyed watching his son's follow in his footsteps to become successful doctors - Dodis is an obstetrician and gynecologist on Long Island, Darius is an otolaryngologist and neurotologist is Manhattan. Influenced by the love of his life, his wife and retired dentist, Simona, Dr. Kohan was the quintessential father and grandfather. Dr. Kohan's interests were not limited to the medical field. He was known as a prolific reader and European and American History expert. He was in essence a living encyclopedia of historical facts and dates. Dr. Kohan is survived by his wife, Simona, two sons, Dodis and Darius, daughter-in-law Ingrid, son-in-law Joseph, and three granddaughters Jacqueline, Lauren, and Corinne.
