Her daughters, Rolly and Rachel; her son-in-law Emilio; her grandchildren, William, Abigail, Catherine, and Alessia; her grand-son-in-law, Felice; and her great-grandchildren Gabriele and Anna join all her friends in thanking her for sharing her wonderful life with us. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-07-10T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  WOODYATT, LOIS HOXIE"}, "snippet": "WOODYATT--Lois Hoxie, November 3, 1915 - July 4, 2016.
