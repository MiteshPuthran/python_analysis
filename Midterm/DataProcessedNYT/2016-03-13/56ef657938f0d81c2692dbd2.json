On behalf of the Newark Academy Board of Trustees, administration and faculty, we express our deepest sympathies to the family of the Honorable Robert J. Del Tufo. During his time as a student at Newark Academy, Mr. Del Tufo left an indelible mark on the Academy. His many gifts, both academic and athletic, led the way for his esteemed career -- from lawyer to public servant. While a student at Newark Academy, Bob was three- sport athlete excelling in football, basketball and baseball. In addition, he served his fellow students as a member of the Student Council and on the staffs of the Academy's yearbook and school newspaper. Bob returned to his alma mater in 1977 as a member of the Newark Academy Board of Trustees, serving as Chairman of the Board from 1984 through 1987 and concluding his Board service in 2002.
