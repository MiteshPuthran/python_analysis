She was never one to be satisfied with the status quo in work or life. Trained as a speech pathologist, she early on learned of what was then a little- known auditory-verbal approach to teaching the deaf and hard of hearing and became a committed advocate of this pioneering technique. A spirited mother and grandmother, she taught us to savor life as a daily adventure. Predeceased by her husband of 64 years, author Ralph G. Martin, whose books she helped edit, she will be deeply missed by her children, Maury (Susan), Elizabeth R. Martin Greenbaum (Daniel), and Tina S. Martin; nephew James Eisenstein; brother Harvey Pastel; and grandchildren Eleanor and Max Martin, Abigail Martin Greenbaum, and Amelia and Maya Martin. Donations in her honor can be sent to the Oberkotter Foundation, 1600 Market St., Suite 3600 Philadelphia, PA 19103, founded by the family of one of her favorite students. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-03-13T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  MARTIN, MARJORIE JEAN PASTEL"}, "snippet": "MARTIN--Marjorie Jean Pastel, died peacefully at her home in Sleepy Hollow, NY on March 9 at age 94.
