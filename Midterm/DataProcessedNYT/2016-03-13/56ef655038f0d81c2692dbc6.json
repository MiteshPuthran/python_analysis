Passed away Saturday, March 5, 2016 peacefully in his home surrounded by his family. The son of David I. and Augusta B. Bennett, he was born in New York City on October 6, 1919. He attended The City College of New York, earning a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering in 1941, and completed graduate work at Stevens Institute of Technology. A Lieutenant in the United States Army, Platoon Commander of the 581st Automatic Weapons Battalion, and an anti-aircraft gunnery instructor, Richard received expert and sharpshooter awards for many types of firearms, including the use of sub machine guns, carbines, and the M1 rifle. He received a citation from President Truman for his service to his country. His career began at Yale & Towne Manufacturing Company in 1941. After his military service 1942-45, he worked as a manufacturing engineer for Western Electric Company 1945-50. Later he would own and operate Fairmont Tool Company in Newark, NJ. from 1950-1951. Between 1952-1964, he would become the general manager of divisions of Daystrom, Inc., overseeing companies on the east and west coast. While working as an engineer for Western Electric, he invented and patented the wire wrap tool used to this day in electronic assembly, although he credits his daughter Nancy with making the first wire wrap connection. From 1964-1984 he worked for ITT Corporation in New York City. His positions included Senior Executive Vice President from 1980; Vice Chairman from 1983-1984; and Director from 1968-1984, and Board Chairman of ITT Ind. Can., 1978-1984. In 1985 he was Vice Chairman, First City Capital Corporation, NYC, a subsidiary of Scovill Inc. During his time there he became Chairman and CEO, continuing to serve as both until his retirement in 1992. Richard divided his time between Palm Beach Gardens, FL and Ocean City, New Jersey. Among his favorite passions were crossword puzzles, baseball and golf. An avid golfer he prided himself on shooting his age at 82, 83, and 88. As his career took him around the world, he played on the best courses in and throughout the world, with many of the great legends of the game. A devoted Yankee fan, in 1929 while attending a home game with his father he saw Babe Ruth hit a home run and got his autograph. Few people knew the Yankees signed Richard as a pitcher in the 1940's. Before the stadium was demolished he bought his father's two seats in Sec. 11 at Yankee Stadium for $20.00 in 1973. They were behind Lou Gehrig, his favorite ball player of all time. Richard was a Mason for over 50 years, a member of the NRA and an avid bird quail hunter. Richard is survived by his wife, the love of his life Bernice (\"Bunny\") O'Keefe Bennett; his children: daughter, Nancy Friss Weiberger; Nancy's daughter Dr. Allison Singer Scott, Allison's sons Harrison and Hunter Scott. Son, Gerald \"Jerry\" Bennett; Jerry's children Caley and Cooper. Stepsons Christopher, Gregory, Geoffrey and Dr. Scott Parratto.
