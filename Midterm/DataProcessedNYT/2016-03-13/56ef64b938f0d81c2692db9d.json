Joy graduated from the Bartram School in Jacksonville, FL and went on to earn an economics degree at Barnard College. One of the first women to work at a nonsecretarial job on Wall Street, Joy worked at Brown Bros. Harriman before her marriage. She left her job to commit herself fully to her family. Joy was a longtime member of and volunteer for the Junior League of New York, and the Traveller's Aid Society. For many years she ran the Gold and Silver Ball, benefitting the Youth Counseling League. Later in life she joined Tiffany & Co. as a fine jewelry sales associate where she worked for 13 years. Joy's main passion, outside of her family, was art and she spent many happy hours going to all the museums and galleries. Joy adored New York City and liked nothing better than to walk for hours, people watching and absorbing the city's energy. In addition to her children and grandchildren, Joy is survived by her loving sister Kay Olson Freeman. A memorial service is planned for later this Spring. \"Say not in grief 'she is no more' but live in thankfulness that she was\". 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-03-13T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  VAN NORDEN, GWENDOLYN \"JOY\""}, "snippet": "VAN NORDEN--Gwendolyn \"Joy\", died peacefully on Friday, February 26th, 2016 at Vicar's Landing, Ponte Vedra Beach, FL.
