He was 89. Born in 1926 in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, Leo and his family immigrated to the United States in 1933. His father, the late Leo van Munching of Greenwich, came as a representative of the Heineken brewery, eventually establishing Van Munching & Company as the exclusive US importer of Heineken brands. Drafted into the United States Navy while in high school, Leo served as a Seabee in the 35th Special Naval Construction Battalion on Oahu, Hawaii from 1944 to 1946. Upon discharge, he enrolled in the University of Maryland on the G.I. Bill, receiving a degree from the College of Business and Management in 1950. After graduation, he went to work for the family business, eventually becoming president of Van Munching & Company, a role he remained in until his retirement in 1993. During his time with Van Munching & Company, no other brand approached Heineken's position as the largest-selling imported beer. In recognition of his outstanding contributions and personal dedication to US-Netherlands trade relations, and his promotion of goodwill for the Netherlands in the United States, Queen Beatrix honored Leo with The Order of Orange-Nassau in 1982. Six years later, the Netherlands Chamber of Commerce in the United States also recognized his role in the expansion of trade between the two countries, presenting him with the George Washington Vanderbilt Award. Leo's efforts as a philanthropist, often anonymous, were made out of appreciation for the opportunities he and his family enjoyed in America. In 1983, he supported the restoration of the Statue of Liberty in memory of his mother, Mia. He donated Van Munching Hall, dedicated in 1992, to house the University of Maryland School of Business, in part to thank the university for its kind treatment of the veterans of World War II. Leo's fervent commitment to supporting education led him to a long-standing relationship with Kolbe Cathedral High School in Bridgeport. His support of that school, both as a benefactor and member of the Advisory Board, prompted the Diocese of Bridgeport to honor him with the Order of St. Augustine Medal of Service in 2012. Leo also established the Van Munching Rehabilitation Unit at Stamford Hospital, was a leadership donor to the construction of the new Darien Library, which opened in 2009, and was a founding donor to the Margaret M. Dyson Vision Research Institute at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. He was an active supporter of several Darien-based charities, and a member of the Wee Burn Country Club. Leo is survived by his wife of 62 years, Peggy, and their eight children: Leo, III (Laura) of San Francisco, CA, Jan Phillips (Charles) of Bonita Springs, FL, Pieter of Darien, Paul (Heather) of Bath, England, Maria of Newport, RI, Anne Ardery (Peter) of Darien, Philip (Christina) of Darien, and Christopher (Kimberly) of Darien. He is also survived by thirteen grandchildren, Kyle, Charlie, Brennan, Annebet, Max, Anneka, Lily, Mia, Megan, William, Anna, Maggie, and Leo, IV, and two great-grandchildren, River and Rory. In addition, he is survived by his sister, Anne Wilsey, of Greenwich. A funeral Mass will be celebrated at St. Thomas More Church in Darien, CT on February 20th at 10:30am.
