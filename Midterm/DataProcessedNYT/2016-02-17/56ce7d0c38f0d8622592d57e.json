A Notice and Eulogy Writ in His Own Hand. Leonard was an economist with a career in bank regulation with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, New York State Banking Department, The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, The National Credit Union Administration, and the US Treasury. He was President of the Depositors Insurance Fund, a private fund insuring deposits of savings banks in Massachusetts from 1981-1994. He was a graduate of CCNY (1951) and earned a Ph.D. at New York University (1975). He served in Korea as a sergeant in the Army for a year during the war. He had a restless intelligence, an intense affect, a sharp wit, and a laugh that filled the room. He had many friends whom he cherished and some enemies of whom he was singularly proud. He fell in love with Jackie 20 minutes after meeting her and never stopped loving her for their 35 years of marriage; he asks her forgiveness for being easier to love than to live with. A private remembrance will be held at a later date. If he wanted you there, you will receive an invitation for good food, good wine, a few laughs, and a few tears. If you wish, a donation may be made to Friends of Acadia (www.friendsofacadia.org) to JSSA Hospice (www.jssa.org /service/jssa-hospice) or the charity of your choice. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-02-17T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  LAPIDUS, LEONARD"}, "snippet": "LAPIDUS--Leonard, 86, on February 13, 2016.
