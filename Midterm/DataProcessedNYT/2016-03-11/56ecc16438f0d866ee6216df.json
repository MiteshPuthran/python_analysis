Stanislaw H. Wellisz, a Polish- born economist and longtime Columbia University professor who helped guide his native country's transition from communism to capitalism, died in New York on February 28. He was 90. Prof. Wellisz specialized in development economics, a field that satisfied his fascination with world cultures and his deep desire to help the poor. He helped draw up a new tariff structure for Nepal, advised city planners in Calcutta and Istanbul, and evaluated World Bank programs in Tanzania. Closer to home, he sought to identify opportunities to start minority businesses as director of the Harlem Development Project from 1968-1969. It was to Poland that he devoted most of his energy. He returned time and again, twice serving as a visiting professor and sending his two sons to summer camps there. He often said his desire to rebuild postwar Poland motivated him to study economics. After Poland threw off communist rule in 1989, Prof. Wellisz served as an advisor to the Solidarity-led government on a successful program of economic ''shock therapy.'' From 1991 to 1997, he taught at the University of Warsaw, helping train a generation of postcommunist economists who moved into important roles in government, academia and business. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from the university as well as the Order of Poland's Rebirth (Polonia Restituta), the nation's highest civilian honor. Prof. Wellisz was born in Warsaw on March 28, 1925. His family fled Poland as German and Soviet troops invaded in 1939 and settled in New York City, where he attended Trinity School. He graduated Magna Cum Laude from Harvard University, where he also earned a PhD after spending two years as a Fulbright Fellow at the University of Cambridge. He was the author of ''The Economies of the Soviet Bloc'' and served as chairman of Columbia's renowned economics department in 1977-82. Prof. Wellisz was fluent in French, Italian and English as well as his native Polish, and his varied intellectual interests ranged from anthropology and literature through art and architecture. He was an avid skier and outdoorsman who loved mushroom hunting and canoeing and a charming story teller who regaled listeners with tales of obscure people and happenings in distant lands. He is survived by his two sons, Tadeusz and Christopher; a nephew, Michael Temmer; and four grandchildren. His remains will be laid to rest at the Lutheran cemetery in Warsaw. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-03-11T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  WELLISZ, STANISLAW"}, "snippet": "WELLISZ--Stanislaw, Columbia Economist Who Aided Poland's Revival.
