Rowland G. Rose, Sr., 99, residing in South Bend, IN passed away at 8:10pm on Monday, March 21, 2016 at Southfield Village, South Bend, IN. Rowland \"Bob\" was born on May 16th 1916 in Newark, NJ to George and Pauline (Gotthardt) Rose. After graduating from East Orange High School he received a BS in Accounting from New York University. He worked at the shipping firm of W.R. Grace until joining the Navy in 1941. In the Navy he rose to the rank of Lieutenant Commander and met and married Elizabeth Kerr Stewart (they remained married for 62 years until her passing in 2004). After the war he became treasurer of Panagra Airlines (which took he and the family to Chile and Peru for several years). In 1958 he joined Miles Laboratories in Elkhart, IN and moved to South Bend. After 24 years with Miles he retired as President and Chief Operating Officer in 1982. Bob also served on the board of Coachmen Industries, Protection Mutual Insurance, Goodwill Industries, and was President of the Signal Point Golf Club in Niles, MI. Known as a quiet and humble man, his greatest pleasures were working in his garden, spending time on the golf course and visiting with extended family. When asked what prompted him to leave the east coast (after 42 years) to live in South Bend he replied simply \"Everyone I met there struck me as good people, the kind with whom I would enjoy working and socializing.\" Mr. Rose is survived by his six children, fifteen grandchildren and eight great-grand- children. Mr. Rose was preceded in death by his grandson, Christopher Bullock in 1986; and his brother, William Rose in 1997. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-04-03T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  ROSE, ROWLAND G."}, "snippet": "ROSE--Rowland G.,Sr. May 16, 1916 - March 21, 2016.
