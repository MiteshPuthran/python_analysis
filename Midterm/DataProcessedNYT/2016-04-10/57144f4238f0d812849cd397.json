Carol was born on September 30, 1937 in Chicago, IL, and later moved to Manitowoc, WI. Even as a child she loved reading and recounted hiding under the covers at night, light in hand, unable to put down her latest book. At sixteen, Carol headed off to the University of Wisconsin, Madison. She completed her undergraduate studies and enrolled in the University's medical school. As a newly minted physician, Carol headed east and found her true home, New York City. She practiced there as a psychiatrist until she moved back to Wisconsin in 2007. Friends in the City knew Carol as a woman who loved the theater. She had a special place in her heart for musicals but relished the chance to see anything new, especially at Lincoln Center. On February 5, 1979, with the birth of her son Bobby, Carol embarked on an adventure that was \"the most fun I've ever had\". Carol is survived by son Robert (Leah) Levy; nephew Adam (Alla) Sperling; niece Shoshanna (Maury) Sperling; and former husband Norman Levy of Los Angeles. She was preceded in death by her parents Henry and Etha (Shaffer) Spiegal, as well as sister Linda (partner Fred) Sperling and her beloved dog Saralinda. The family suggests memorial contributions be made to Lincoln Center Theater. Services handled by the Brown Funeral Home, 1480 E. Hill Rd., Grand Blanc, MI 48439.
