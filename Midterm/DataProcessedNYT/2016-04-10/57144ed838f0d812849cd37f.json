Suzy was a distinctive person, endowed with natural beauty and a special grace and inner strength. She had a marvelous sense of humor and loved to laugh, particularly when her two sons were cutting up over a meal. She had a natural understanding of people and was always constructive in her views. She was kind and generous and always welcomed guests into her homes. She was fiercely loyal to her family, whom she loved dearly. Suzy was an enormously creative presence in the world, bringing a compelling appreciation for the beauty of nature and gardening through the 15 books she authored, and her numerous speeches and television appearances. She was the gardening editor at \"Better Homes & Gardens,\" and a columnist for \"The New York Times\" and for \"Newsday.\" Suzy was a transformative leader. She chaired the Board of Graham Windham for 15 years, and was awarded the first \"Elizabeth Hamilton Great American Philanthropist Award,\" in recognition of her outstanding service, continuing the legacy of Graham Windham's founder of caring for NYC's most vulnerable children and families. Suzy also served on the Boards of Hofstra University and Hunter College Foundation. Suzy is survived by her husband, Carter F. Bales, and their four children: Thomas E. Meacham, Margaret Meacham Klemm (Richard), Carter F. Bales II, and Cathryn E. Bales; her two grandchildren, Andrew and Olivia Klemm, the lights of her life; her mother, Dorothy Frutig; her sister, Jayne Mengel; her brother, Edward Frutig; and their families.
