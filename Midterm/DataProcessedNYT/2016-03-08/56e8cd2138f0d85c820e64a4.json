It is with profound sadness that Weill Cornell Medicine mourns the loss of Cornell University President Elizabeth Garrett. Beth was a passionate and dedicated leader, distinguished legal scholar, and tremendous friend whose commitment to collaboration was exemplified by her inspiring interactions with Cornell University faculty, staff and students. In her eight months as Cornell's 13th president and the first woman to lead the university, Beth was a visionary figure who embodied the power of education, research, scholarship, creativity and public engagement to drive critical advances and make a difference in society. She was devoted to deepening what she called the \"special synergy\" between Weill Cornell Medicine, the Cornell Tech campus on Roosevelt Island and the university in Ithaca, fostering partnerships that seek to promote new lines of scholarly inquiry. Her exemplary stewardship will ensure that the university continues to drive excellence and that its community be trailblazers. Beth was a remarkable woman and an exemplar of the Cornell spirit. We will greatly miss her intellect, candor and dynamism. In her memory, Weill Cornell Medicine has established a fund to advance colon cancer research; contributions can be made to the President Elizabeth Garrett Fund for Colon Cancer Research, Meyer Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Medicine, 1300 York Avenue, Box 314, New York, NY 10065. Our heartfelt condolences to her husband, Dr. Andrei Marmor, their family and friends. Dr. Laurie H. Glimcher, Stephen and Suzanne Weiss Dean; Jessica M.
