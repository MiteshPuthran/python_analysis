January 7. The partners, attorneys and staff of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP mourn the passing of our colleague and friend Judith Kaye. Before joining our New York appellate litigation and arbitration practice in 2009, Judith spent 25 years on the bench of the New York Court of Appeals, including the last 15 as its Chief Judge. The first woman to serve on New York's highest court, Judith earned a national reputation for her pioneering opinions and court reforms. She wrote seminal opinions on such issues as the death penalty, same-sex marriage, education and state constitutional rights while leading innovative changes to the New York court system, including the establishment of specialized courts to focus on issues of drug addiction, domestic violence and mental health. As Chief Judge, Judith created the Adoption Now program, helped establish the Center for Court Innovation and co-chaired the ABA Commission on the American Jury. She retired from the bench in 2008, having served longer than any Chief Judge in state history. At Skadden, Judith helped numerous clients navigate complex issues of New York law. She also served as a trustee of the Skadden Fellowship Foundation and continued her advocacy for families and children, including through her service as the chairwoman of the Permanent Judicial Commission on Justice for Children. Judith graduated from Barnard College ('58) and NYU School of Law ('62), where she was one of 10 women in a class of nearly 300. Judith is survived by her children, Luisa, Jonathan and Gordon, and seven grandchildren. She will be greatly missed. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-01-08T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  KAYE, JUDITH"}, "snippet": "KAYE--Judith.
