He was 82 years old. At the UN, Mr. Mendez designed and arranged financing of broad-based programs and specific projects of assistance to the world's poorest countries. He also administered their implementation and evaluation. Mr. Mendez contributed to theoretical work in economics, introducing a new discipline of international public finance. He proposed novel ideas about the global commons, and how to finance, internationally, its responsible development and conservation. His seminal book, \"International Public Finance: A New Perspective on Global Relations,\" was published by Oxford University Press in 1994. The first comprehensive treatment of a much debated topic, it set forth new concepts of global public good, positive and negative externalities, and the international public sector. Mr. Mendez taught for many years as a visiting lecturer at Yale College and adjunct professor at New York University. At the time of his death, he was working on a methodology for applying cost-benefit analysis to foreign policy decision making. He sought to define benefits and costs in a more rigorous, objective way than current practices, to enable foreign policy determinations less influenced by ideology and alliances, giving greater weight to projected outcomes. Ruben Mendez grew up in Manila and New York City. He graduated from Harvard College. He received an M.A. from Columbia University and Ph.D. from NYU. He was predeceased by his wife of fifty-four years, Matilda McEwen Mendez. He is survived by a daughter Katherine, son Tomas, and three grandsons, all of New York. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-03-31T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  MENDEZ, RUBEN P."}, "snippet": "MENDEZ--Ruben P.,a development economist and former senior United Nations official, died at his home in Riverdale, NY on March 29.
