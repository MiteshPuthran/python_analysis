Joan Corliss Gardiner was born in New York City in 1929 and raised in Washington, DC. She graduated from Mt. Vernon Seminary in Washington, DC, and went on to graduate from Radcliffe College as an English major. During her four years in Cambridge, Joan developed an office romance with Thomas Cunningham Simons, while both were working together as business managers of The Harvard Crimson. Married shortly after graduation, Joan Gardiner Simons and her husband Tom moved to California where he launched his career in the insurance business. They had four children in the years that followed: Tom, who lives in South Carolina and Gloucester, MA; Martha, who lives in South Londonderry, VT; Sarah, who lives in Woodside, CA; and John, who lives in Briarcliff Manor, NY. Joan was predeceased by her sister, Jean Luckett Schmitt. During her husband's insurance career, Joan transcended the role of corporate wife, relishing her responsibility and their partnership. In fact, a former colleague of her husband said, \"She was the all time greatest corporate wife. She remembered everybody's name and she treated everybody with respect.\" A sister-in-law would occasionally admit, \"It is no contest. Joan Simons is the brightest light in this family. Hands down.\" Though Joan's traditional role was demanding, she forged her own identity as the Simons family moved to the Hartford area and then to Louisville, KY. She was a founding Board member of The Westledge School in West Simsbury, CT. She served as Chair of the Board at The Hartford College for Women, as well as on the Bellarmine University and Berea College Boards. Joan also served on the Louisville Water Company Board. Shortly after her husband Tom died in 1988, Joan married James K. Brown, whose wife was recently deceased. Former college classmates, they settled in Briarcliff Manor, spending summers in South Londonderry, VT. For the past few years Joan and Jim Brown made their primary home at The Osborn in Rye, NY. Joan developed her talent and competitive spirit on the golf courses of The Hartford Golf Club, The Louisville Golf Club, The Ekwanok Golf Club in Manchester, VT, and The Sleepy Hollow Golf Club in Briarcliff Manor. She delighted in her membership in both the Green Mountain Girls (Manchester, VT) and the National Society of Colonial Dames. In her later years, nothing gave Joan greater joy than when any of her children and grandchildren, from both marriages, would come calling. She was interested in, unconditionally supportive of, and totally devoted to every aspect of their lives. Joan Simons Brown spent her last days of this life in a room festooned with dozens of pictures of her kids, grandchildren and spouses. They are testimony to the richness of her life and the sustenance that she received from the people she loved and the people who loved her. A service is planned for 11am on Saturday, April 2 at All Saints' Episcopal Church, 201 Scarborough Road, Briarcliff Manor. In lieu of flowers, Joan's families have requested that donations can be made to the South Londonderry Free Library, 15 Old School Road, South Londonderry, VT 05155. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-03-31T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  BROWN, JOAN SIMONS"}, "snippet": "BROWN--Joan Simons, was surrounded by loving family on this past Good Friday when she slipped peacefully out of this life and into the next one.
