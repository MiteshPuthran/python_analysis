She is survived by three children: a daughter Evgenia Pujol and her husband Raoul of New York City, and two sons, Michael and his wife Donna Carter of Austin, Texas, and Peter and his wife Gail of Sunderland, Massachusetts; and by two grandchildren: Daniel and his wife Nicole Cappelletty of Denver, Colorado, and Alexandra of Austin, Texas; and by her brother Larry Hughes and his wife Rose of Southport, Connecticut. Her husband of 62 years, Andrew, predeceased her in 2002, as did her youngest son Nicholas in 1971. She is also survived by her loving and devoted caregiver of many years, Lina Calabrese of Torrington, Lina's husband Angelo, and their daughter Leondina Foster. The family will be forever grateful to them. She was born June 27, 1918 in New York City, the only child of James and Margaret Porter. She never knew her father; he was killed in action in October, 1918, near Verdun, France. She graduated from Bennington College in three years in 1939, and married a month later. Four children followed over the next nine years. In 1946, the family moved to Litchfield, CT, where she lived for the rest of her life. She was a smart, independent, private, and unfailingly generous and polite person. She grew up in an age and in circumstances where she was not expected to work. Once the children were grown and on their own, she went back to school and got a Masters in Linguistics from New York University. There was no practical reason for this, but she just enjoyed learning something new. She was a pacifist and was an early opponent to the Vietnam War. She was active in \"Clergy and Laymen Against the War,\" and along with her husband was listed on President Nixon's \"enemies list,\" a distinction she was very proud of. She was interested in the arts of all kinds, but especially theater and modern art (painting and sculpture). She spent many years as a volunteer for Playwrights Horizons in New York. And the house in Litchfield had an assortment of works of art, usually purchased from artists not yet famous but soon to be; the art would stay around for a decade or two and then be sent off to some museum to be enjoyed by the general public. She loved to read. Her other main volunteer interest was the Oliver Wolcott Library in Litchfield. She was instrumental in its move to its current building on South Street and served a term as President of the Board of Trustees; in addition she was a regular volunteer there for many years. She enjoyed golf, tennis, and especially skiing, both alpine and cross-country. She skied into her early 80s. She made weekly trips to New York City. She loved both the quiet of Litchfield and the vibrancy of the city. Her last years were spent at her home in Litchfield, still making the occasional trip to the city and still enjoying the visits of her children and grandchildren. A celebration of her life will be held on Saturday, April 16 at noon at her home at 108 Gallows Lane in Litchfield. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to the Oliver Wolcott Library, 160 South St., Litchfield, CT, 06759.
