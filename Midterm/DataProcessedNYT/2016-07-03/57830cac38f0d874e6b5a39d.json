Baldev Duggal was made of eternal optimism. He saw opportunity where others saw none. \"If you don't have a dream, you have nothing,\" he often remarked. Baldev's dream was to leave the world better than he found it, and he went on to paint on a broader canvas. Baldev Duggal is survived by his three children: Susheila Kidman and husband Scott, Dave Duggal and wife Jennifer, Michael Duggal and wife Mollie. He is also survived by his eight grandchildren: Ryan, Brett and Lauren Kidman; Cyrus and Eloise Duggal; Faith, John Alexander and Christian Duggal; as well as his brother Sukhdev Duggal.
