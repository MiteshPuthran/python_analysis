Loving brother of Rosalie and Judith and brother-in-law of David (Carolyn) and loving friend to Roz Lipps. He was married to Barbara Peyster Roth for 55 years until her passing in 2003. Charles was a devoted father, husband, grandfather and friend to all. Charles was the consummate fixer upper; from plumbing, electrical and carpentry to clocks, computers, golf carts, and more. While he loved his golf, tennis and cards, he most of all loved helping friends and family. His quick wit and storytelling will be greatly missed by family and friends from New York and Florida. Donations may be made in his memory to Boca Regional Hospital. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-07-03T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  ROTH, CHARLES W."}, "snippet": "ROTH--Charles W.,88, of Boca Raton, FL, formerly East Hills, NY, succumbed to Parkinson's after a long heroic battle surrounded by his daughters and companion on June 23, 2016.
