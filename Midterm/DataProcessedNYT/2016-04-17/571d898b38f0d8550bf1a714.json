The entire Yeshiva University family is deeply grieved by the recent passing of our cherished longtime friend, Halina Bitensky, Z'l, who, together with her late beloved husband, Samson Bitensky, Z'l, a Yeshiva University Trustee and the founding Chair of the Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology Board of Overseers, and a Vice Chair of the Sy Syms School of Business, was a Benefactor of Yeshiva University. They established the Samson and Halina Bitensky Chair in Economics at Yeshiva University, which was held by the late Professor Aaron Levine, who published several books in their honor, and they also established scholarship funds at Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology and Stern College for Women. Halina Bitensky was a kind, gentle, generous, humble, compassionate and gracious lady. She was a proud mother of her two daughters and sons-in-law, Dr. Beth (and Steven) Myers, who was Chair of the Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology Board of Overseers, and Susan (and Peter) Lerner, Esq., a past member of the Yeshiva University Museum Board of Overseers. Halina and Samson Bitensky were among the sponsors of the \"Perfect Fit\" Exhibit. She was an adoring grandmother and great grandmother. She had many friends who shared the values of the Bitensky family in philanthropic work on behalf of higher education here and in Israel.
