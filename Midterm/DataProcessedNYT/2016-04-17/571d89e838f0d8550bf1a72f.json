October 14, 1934 -- March 18, 2016. With deep sadness we announce the death of Percy Chubb, III, of Bernardsville, NJ, who passed away on March 18th at Morristown Medical Center, after a sudden illness. Born in 1934 in New York City and known as \"Pie\" to family, \"Pi\" to business associates, and \"Ace\" to his grandchildren, Percy graduated from the Thacher School in Ojai, CA, and Yale University. He spent his professional career at Chubb and Son, later Chubb Corporation, the insurance company founded in 1882 by his grandfather and great-uncle, Hendon and Percy Chubb, where he began as a trainee in 1958. He became a Director of the company in 1978 and served in numerous capacities, more recently as Vice Chairman and as a member of the Policy Committee. He retired as an officer of the company in 1997. Percy was a trustee of the Wood's Hole Oceanographic Institute, the Mystic Seaport, and the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, and was a Director of Safeway Stores and First Fidelity Bank Corporation. For over forty years, he was a trustee of the Victoria Foundation, a Newark-based philanthropic institution founded in 1924 by his grandfather, Hendon Chubb, and dedicated to improving the lifetime prospects of stressed families in need. He spent thirty of those years serving as President of the Board. He was an experienced sailor and an avid and competitive outdoorsman, who loved hunting, fly fishing, tennis, and skiing, almost always with family and friends. In his later years he tolerated golf. Percy leaves behind his wife and dance partner of 59 years, the former Sally Gilady; three children, Lee Chubb and Lucy Chubb, both of Ketchum, Idaho, and Sarah Chubb Sauvayre of New York City; and four grandchildren who called him \"Ace,\" at his insistence. A memorial service and celebration of Percy's life is planned for May 14 at 4pm, at the Somerset Hills Country Club in Bernardsville, NJ. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that you consider a donation to the Community FoodBank of New Jersey: http://www.cfbnj.org 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-04-17T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  CHUBB, PERCY CHUBB III"}, "snippet": "CHUBB--Percy Chubb III.
