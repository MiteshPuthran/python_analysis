He was 76 years of age. Steve was born March 9, 1940 in Brooklyn, New York. His father Michael Rosentraub, was a New York City Taxicab Driver and his mother Jenny Rosentraub, a homemaker. Unfortunately, Jenny died when Steve was just six years old. Steve often referred to the memory of her death, as a \"defining moment\" that built his tenacity to make every minute of life count. His drive and determination for success started at a young age. In 1956, Steve was then the youngest-ever graduate of Stuyvesant High School and received his undergraduate and graduate degrees from Cornell University, where he excelled academically and forged a lifelong relationship with the school. He had a varied and successful career with numerous accolades and achievements. Steve began his career in the mid 1960's at Ford Motor Company in the Product Planning Group. From Ford, he transitioned to become President of Hertz Trucks (present-day Penske Corporation). After leaving Hertz, Steve went on to hold the position of President and CEO of Seatrain Lines, a NYSE-listed company. Later, he led Barsac, a general contracting company responsible for the construction of Riyadh King Khalid Airport in Saudi Arabia. In 1985, Steve co-founded Celadon Group, Inc., and became the company's Chairman and CEO in 1995. Under his leadership, Celadon had grown to become one of Indiana's largest employers and one of the United States' top fifty truck transportation companies. His philanthropic endeavors were numerous. He worked tirelessly to give advantages to those in need. Some of his most notable contributions were in the areas of education and the arts. Steve was passionate about providing others with the advantage of an education. In addition to being a Life Member of the Cornell University Council and Emeritus Member of the Johnson Graduate School of Management Advisory Council, he established four separate scholarship funds and awards at Cornell. He was proud to have created and funded the Russell Family Scholarship, the Russell Family First Generation Scholarship, the Stephen Russell Family Teaching Award for the College of Arts and Sciences and the Stephen Russell Family Teaching Award for the Johnson Graduate School of Management. In his desire to make a difference closer to home, he formed The Russell Education Fund at Phoenix Theatre in Indianapolis, which provides theatre tickets to area students for local productions. Steve served on the boards of Herron High School, Eiteljorg Museum, IUPUI, Phoenix Theatre and, from 2010-2012, he served as the Chairman of the Indianapolis Museum of Art. Steve also funded the student access program at the IMA and contributed to the IMA Design Center, which was built in 2014. Steve's family was certainly his proudest achievement. He will be missed most by those who knew and loved him best. He is survived by his wife, Livia Klain Russell. He is also survived by the mother of his children, Margery Russell; beloved children, Melissa (Matthew) Rubel and their children, Jeffrey, Michael and Joshua; Stewart (Meg) Russell and their children, Charlie and Zachary; Jonathan (Sue) Russell and their children, Jason and William; sister, Pearl Greene and his nieces, Jan Greene and Victoria (Mohammad) Uni. Steve's brother, Jules Russell, preceded him in death. Funeral services will be held at Congregation Beth-El Zedeck, 600 West 70th Street, Indianapolis, Indiana 46260 on Sunday, April 17, 2016. Burial will follow in Beth-El Zedeck's Memorial Park Cemetery, Fishers, IN.
