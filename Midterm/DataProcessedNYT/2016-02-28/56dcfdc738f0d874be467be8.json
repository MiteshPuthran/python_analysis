One could not have wished for a better friend than Michael Jaharis. He was generous with his time, his wisdom, his care and his humor. His concern for you and what was happening in your life was evident. He and his wife, Mary, were instrumental to my conversion to the Greek Orthodox Christian faith for which I will always be deeply grateful. Our condolences to Mary with whom he accomplished his many wonderful deeds; his daughter, Kathryn; his son, Dr. Steven and his wife Elaine; and the grandchildren, Melina, Michael, Valerie, Wilder and Ava. May your joyful memories of the many happy days spent with Michael and your knowledge of what you meant to him, and he to you ease your sorrow.
