He was born in Manhattan, New York, the son of Robert Dean Grimm Sr. and Virginia Kraft. His father and his only child Payson Dean Grimm preceded him in death. He leaves his mother Virginia Kraft Payson of Indiantown, Florida, Lexington, Kentucky and Saratoga Springs, New York, three sisters, Tana Aurland Bostian (Jeff) of East Hampton, Massachusetts, Tara Kraft Grimm of Paris, France and Jill Aurland of Vernon Hills, Illinois, a nephew and two nieces. Dean was raised at the Gipsy Trail Club near Carmel, New York. He spent his early years playing tennis, Trap Shooting, (Dean shot his first \"perfect round\" of trap at age eight using a 20-guage specially retooled shotgun), and downhill skiing at Grayrocks in the Laurentian Mountains of Quebec, Canada. Dean attended Frederick Military Academy in Portsmouth, Virginia, graduated from Salisbury Prepratory School in Salisbury, Connecticut and The University of Kentucky in Lexington, Kentucky, receiving a BA in Political Science. He was the co- breeder with his mother of 1992 Irish Derby winner St. Jovite, who was named after the town in the Laurentians where Dean learned to ski. St. Jovite, who posted the fastest Irish Derby time in 150 years, and was named 1992 European Horse of the Year, stood at stud initially at Dean's solely owned Payson Stud Management, LLC, before moving to Ireland where he stood the better part of his stud career. St. Jovite died earlier this year at age 27. Dean later bred and sold (in partnership with actor Woody Harrelson and Len Green), the highest priced thoroughbred weanling colt in North America, and the last stakes-winning son of Seattle Slew, Council Member, to go to stud. At the time of his death Dean was currently President of The Breeders Association (TBA), owner of the National Stud, LLC, owner of Payson Stud Management, LLC, former Director of Cardinal Bancshares, Vine Street Trust, and World Gaming, 1998 Philanthropist of the Year (National Philanthropic Association of America), Founding Member, co-owner Smoke Switchers.com, Rand Paul Victory Committee. Dean lost his only child, 20- year old Payson Dean Grimm in an auto accident on 15 February 2016. For the twenty years since his son's birth, Dean waged an unsuccessful legal battle with his son's mother, to whom he was never married, for visitation rights to his son. The death of his son put Dean in a state of depression much worse than any he had previously experienced. His many good friends and his loving family were unable to relieve his pain. Six days after his son's death, Dean joined him. May they live side-by- side in perpetual peace until the Lord raises them up to Eternal Glory. Catholic services were held at the Newman Center, University of Kentucky, on Wednesday 24 February with interment on Friday at Raymond Hill Cemetery in Carmel, New York. In lieu of flowers, expressions of sympathy in the name of Dean Grimm may be made to The Newman Center, 320 Rose Lane, Lexington, KY 40508. www.milward funeral.com 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-02-28T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  GRIMM, ROBERT DEAN, JR."}, "snippet": "GRIMM--Robert Dean, Jr.,known as Dean, died suddenly in Lexington, Kentucky on 21 February at the age of 54 years and one month.
