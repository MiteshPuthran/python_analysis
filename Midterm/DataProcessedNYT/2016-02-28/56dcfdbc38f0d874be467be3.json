A consummate actor, story teller and entertainer, he honed his skills during the Korean War doing stand- up and entertaining the troops. He carried a weapon but always preferred bullets of laughter. Born in Pasadena, California on April 4, 1929, Bud grew up in San Francisco and Pasadena. His mother Bessie taught young Humbert to play the piano and this accomplishment made him the life of every party. As a teenager he loved souping up hot rods and burning rubber on the streets. His father Humbert Sr. infused his son with a passion for all the arts. Bud learned to sail a boat and to hunt and fish with his father on the Russian River and in the Sierra Nevadas. After the military, Humbert studied acting at the Pasadena Playhouse, worked in local theaters in Los Angeles and established a classical theater company, The Hollywood Center Theatre. In 1965 he loaded his possessions into his truck and drove to New York City, where he was immediately recognized as a very special talent and cast by Joe Papp for Shakespeare in the Park, which led to his big break playing Sergius in \"Arms and the Man\". Humbert was an early client and lifelong friend of agent Don Buchwald. He performed with James Earl Jones in \"Othello\", and became a fixture in off- broadway and regional theaters. He became wildly popular as a star of \"Dark Shadows\", the innovative gothic TV soap opera of the late 60's. Humbert toured nationally with both Frank Langella and Martin Landau in \"Dracula\". On Broadway he performed in Gore Vidal's \"An Evening with Richard Nixon\", Lorraine Hansberry's \"Les Blancs\" and the world tour of \"Little Foxes\" with Elizabeth Taylor. For 10 years he made his sailboat the \"Whimsey\" his home and later retired to a historical farm house in Guilford, Connecticut, where he continued to receive fan mail from followers of his career. Humbert is predeceased by his daughter Jennifer \"Jenny\" and survived by the Hanson Family and the Small Family. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-02-28T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  ASTREDO, HUMBERT ALLEN JR \"BUD\""}, "snippet": "ASTREDO--Humbert Allen Jr \"Bud\", passed into the universe on February 19, 2016.
