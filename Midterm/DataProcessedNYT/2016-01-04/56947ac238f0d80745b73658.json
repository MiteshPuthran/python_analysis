Nicholas James Tryforos, son of James and Garufa, was the youngest and last survivor of thirteen children. In explaining why \"Mama and Papa had thirteen children, not twelve or fourteen\" Nick said, \"When I was born, papa picked me up, checked me out, and said 'Mama! FINALLY a perfect baby.'\" A lifelong New Yorker, he was a proud graduate of The Greek American Institute, Theodore Roosevelt High School and New York University. He served in the Army in WWII. After basic training, the Army sent him to language school to become a Hindustani interpreter. He received horse cavalry and military intelligence training, and then served in the Philippines and in General MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo during the occupation of Japan. Nick used his Hindustani skills for the rest of his life to surprise and delight both friends and complete strangers from India. After returning from Japan Nick worked for 15 years in the family flower and novelty business, then had a 25-year career with the IRS, retiring in 1986 as a Group Manager, supervising large corporation tax audits. Amateur gymnast, superb photographer, family documenter and archivist, Nick was the favorite uncle of many and worked hard to make and cultivate relationships with family and friends. He collected any piece of junk that could potentially serve a future purpose, taught his children the value of a dollar and the importance of grunt labor, and was the original tiger mom and DIY guy. He was the resident teaser (while being wheeled to major surgery with four children at home, Nick whispered to his wife \"don't worry dear, as long as we have our health!\") and an inveterate joke teller (\"Have you heard the one about the skeleton that walked into a bar...\"). Nick delighted in meeting his children's friends, showing them photos related (and unrelated!) to their discussion, and always enjoyed giving them another tour of the garage! Nick was quietly proud of everyone in his family, and his family was very fortunate to have him. He leaves behind his dear wife of 63 years and best friend Mary, and his children, Margaret and her husband Paul, Jim and his wife Sue, Tom, and Tina and her husband David. He also leaves his grandchildren, Peter, Evan, Kate and her husband Pat, John, Lucas, Eva, and Eli, and great-grandson Theo. Within minutes of Nick's passing, his second great-grandson, Grant, was born. Visitation will be held from 6 to 9pm Monday, January 4th at Frederick Funeral Home in Flushing, and funeral services at 11:30am Tuesday at St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church in Flushing. In lieu of flowers, donations can be sent to SmileTrain.com, DoctorsWithoutBorders.com or World Vision In Support of Syrian Refugees. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-01-04T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  TRYFOROS, NICHOLAS JAMES"}, "snippet": "TRYFOROS--Nicholas James, July 27, 1923-December 31, 2015.
