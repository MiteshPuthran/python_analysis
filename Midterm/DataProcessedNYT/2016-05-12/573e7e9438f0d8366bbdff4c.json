He was 94. A native New Yorker resident in Florida since his retirement, Peter loved dancing, golf, pinochle, pasta aioli and his 1986 Mercedes. His sense of humor seldom failed and his deep appreciation and love for his many friends and his family never did. The son of Vincenzo and Luca Corsello, Peter grew up above the family's Italian bakery in Brooklyn, New York, where his father baked sweet Italian bread in a wood fired oven 365 nights a year. After WW II service as a gunnery instructor and in Army intelligence, Peter returned to New York to complete a construction/design program and work with Sonneborn & Sons, soon becoming the company's go to technical expert in waterproofing product applications. Peter pioneered the development of fluid applied membranes and other waterproofing solutions for masonry and curtain wall structures, first as president of Toch Brothers, a waterproofing company founded in the 1800's and later as president of his own consulting firm, Peter Corsell Associates. Projects to which Peter contributed included Chicago's Sears Tower and, together with the PCA team of architects and building engineers, the remediation of curtain wall failures at Boston's John Hancock Building and development of specifications designed to preserve landmark masonry buildings throughout the northeast, including New York's iconic Chrysler Building. Peter is survived by four children, three grandchildren and one great-grandson. The family is planning memorial services in New York City and The Villages later this year. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-05-12T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  CORSELL, PETER P."}, "snippet": "CORSELL--Peter P.,passed away peacefully on Thursday, May 5, 2016, at Cornerstone Hospice Center in The Villages, Florida.
