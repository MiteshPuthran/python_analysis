Born June 3, 1926 in Cleveland, Ohio to May Glenn and Carl Hans Tiedemann. At the age of three Carl lost his father in the midst of the Great Depression. His mother moved Carl and his sister Frances to Plainfield, New Jersey where she had family and a support system. Carl served in the Navy in World War II and he was forever a devout supporter and champion of America's greatness. Carl attended Phillips Exeter Academy followed by Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut. He was the founder of the school's lacrosse program and later had the honor of being inducted into Trinity's Lacrosse Hall of Fame. After college, Carl began his professional career in sales at American Cyanamid, one of the nation's largest conglomerates at the time. While he honed his sales skills, he always had his eye on Wall Street and jumped at the chance to begin his career at Stone & Webster, a small brokerage firm. A few years later in 1962, when offered the opportunity to join a new firm, Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette (DLJ), he quickly accepted. After working his way up the ranks, in 1975 he took over as President until his departure in 1980 to start the Tiedemann Investment Group (TIG). Carl served on the boards of Alltel Corporation, Curtice Burns, Claremont Capital Corp, Dillon Read & Co., Nikko Securities International, Kleinwort Benson International, National Medical Care, Piedmont Management Company, Winrock International (a Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation), was a Trustee of the Allen-Stevenson school, and also served as a Governor of the American Stock exchange from 1969 to 1972. At TIG, Carl utilized his global network of contacts to source investment talent and provide financial backing and infrastructure to help build their hedge fund business. He loved finding talented individuals while giving them the opportunity to harness their entrepreneurial energy. Those efforts led to a variety of successful funds through the years, and a business that is still thriving 36 years later as one of the longest standing firms in the hedge fund industry. The company that was Carl's longtime dream to found was Tiedemann Trust Company, now known as Tiedemann Wealth Management (TWM). It was Carl's belief that families had been poorly served by large institutions \"wrought with conflicts and inflexibility\" for decades. This view was forged from his own family experience in dealing with a traditional trust bank. He wanted to build a trust company that could invest with the best and the brightest, but without any conflict or financial arrangement with the money managers. It was a simple concept, but one that was not being offered. This open architecture model is now the standard within the industry, as even the large institutions have had to pivot their business models to adapt to new competition from firms like TWM. As a leader, Carl was remarkably positive. In the face of the greatest challenges he would find a silver lining. He was the eternal optimist. His legacy is a unique one, and will live on through his two businesses, now larger and more institutional than at any point in his life, but with the same great culture he created. Carl is survived by his wife, Kari Jonassen Tiedemann. He is also survived by his four children, Hans Tiedemann of Santa Monica, CA; Mark Tiedemann of Los Angeles, CA; Leigh Tiedemann of Lexington, MA; Michael Tiedemann of New York, NY, and their respective spouses. Carl is also survived by 11 grandchildren. Carl was a member of the University Club, Maidstone Club, Link Club, River Club of New York, Doubles, Angler's Club, Tabusintac Club, Club at Windermere, Economic Club of New York, and Long Island Wyandanch Club. A memorial service will be held on Tuesday, May 24, 2016 at 10:45am at St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church, 325 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10022. Instead of flowers, the family suggests a gift to The Tiedemann Family Scholarship Fund at the Middlesex School, 1400 Lowell Road, Concord, MA 01742. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-05-12T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  TIEDEMANN, CARL HANS II"}, "snippet": "TIEDEMANN--Carl Hans II, age 89, died peacefully on Saturday April 30, 2016 at his home in New York City.
