He then became associated with the Wormser Kiely law firm in 1969 and rapidly rose to partner in 1973.

After moving with his family from Westchester to Manhattan, Bob joined the Board of Directors of The Connaught, a large cooperative apartment building on East 54th Street, and was elected President of the Board, a position he held at the time of his death. Bob never allowed his busy professional practice or his Board activities to interfere with his unremitting devotion to his family and friends and his commitment to the game of golf with his longtime friends. Bob is survived by his loving wife Bonnie of 47 years, his son Marc and his wife Samantha, his daughter Jodi and her husband Thomas Sargent, and his wonderful grandchildren Luke, Emma, Simone and Arlo. He is also survived by his sister Helen's children, Michelle and Jeffrey and all of his nieces and nephews.
