The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art mourn the death of Gilbert Silverman. A longstanding member of the Museum's Trustee Committee on Archives, Library, and Research, Gilbert, along with his wife Lila, began collecting works by Fluxus artists in 1978. In 2008 the Museum acquired, through the generosity of Gilbert and Lila, the Gilbert and Lila Silverman Fluxus Collection and Archives, widely considered the largest and most important collection of its kind in the world. Assembled in Detroit over three decades by the Silvermans, the collection comprises over 4,000 works in mediums ranging from printed ephemera, multiples, drawings, and sculptural objects, to photographs and film. The Silverman Collection also incorporates an archival and library component of over 5,500 files containing artists' correspondence, notebooks and scrapbooks, and publications, as well as documents and photographs related to Fluxus performances and events from the 1960s to the 1990s. Gilbert and Lila's collecting was iconoclastic, as much as the movement of Fluxus was itself. With a love of experimentation, chance operation and unceasing inventiveness, Gilbert's vision embraced the lives of artists whose works he collected, as much as the works themselves. We extend our deepest sympathies to Lila, a member of the Museum's Trustee Committee on Archives, Library, and Research, his children, and their families.
