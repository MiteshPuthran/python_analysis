She was predeceased by her beloved husband, Carlisle Jones. Born in Chicago, IL on July 9, 1932, daughter of Austin A. McNichols and Marie Doherty McNichols, Jeanne was a graduate of Barrat College of The Sacred Heart. She was predeceased by her siblings Austin McNichols, Marilyn McNichols Hosty and Frank McNichols. Jeanne was a lover of life and the embodiment of classic New York. She surrounded herself with friends and family throughout the world. She could often be found in New York City, Chicago, Essex Fells, Bay Head, Princeton, Point O' Woods, Bermuda, the Bahamas, London and France. She brought love and laughter to all who crossed her path. Jeanne loved to entertain and play games of all sorts; with a particular fondness for bridge and crosswords. After a stint as a fashion model and a long career as a renown international interior designer, she settled in and devoted her time to charitable pursuits. She was a twenty year board member of the Central Park Conservancy; a member of the Tree Trust Committee; faithful benefactor of the Central Park Conservancy luncheon; and great patron of The New York Botanical Garden, to name a few. Survived by her loving children Joseph Fusco (Pamela), William Fusco, John Fusco, Thomas Fusco (Laurie), Stephen Fusco (Michele), Julie Fusco Lanning (Michael); her cherished grandchildren Davis, Scott, Tracey, Carly, Brooke, Katie, Austin, Matt, Kerry, Tommy, Lindsay, Dalton, Tripp, and Gardner; and her five dear step-children Debbie Jones Lupton (Steve), Geoffrey Jones, Leslie Jones Brittain (John), Betsy Jones Hall (Tyler), Andrew Jones, eleven step-grandchildren, and one step-great-grandchild. There will be a celebration of life in Manhattan during September, with time and place to follow. In lieu of flowers, please give donations to the Central Park Conservancy or The New York Botanical Garden. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-06-17T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  JONES, JEANNE MCNICHOLS"}, "snippet": "JONES--Jeanne McNichols, 83, of 912 5th Avenue New York, NY, died peacefully on Tuesday, June 7th in Nice, France, with her loving family and friends by her side.
