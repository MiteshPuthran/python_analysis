Devoted mother, grandmother, and gentle spirit, beloved by all. Born in Aub, Germany in the shadow of Nazism, she went on to lead a full and happy life. Arriving in New York on the S.S. Manhattan, she lived first in Washington Heights, then in Valley Stream, Long Island, and finally on the Upper East Side. She went from darning socks for ice cream money to helping out in her parents' hardware store to a career in publishing, fashion and publicity before her marriage to her husband and soulmate, Richard. She was devoted to him, and he to her, for 58 years until his death in 2013. She enjoyed art, theater, ballet, film, bridge, historical novels, and chocolate, not necessarily in that order. Most of all, she cherished family and friends and loved spending time at her summer home in Seaview, Fire Island. She was refined yet unpretentious, stylish yet traditional, wise yet always young for her age, and her warmth, charm, and originality were a delight. Active until the end, she died after a brief battle with lymphoma. She is survived by her son David, daughter Nancy Gardiner, son-in-law Nat, and grandchildren Eliza Stensland and Charlotte Gardiner.
