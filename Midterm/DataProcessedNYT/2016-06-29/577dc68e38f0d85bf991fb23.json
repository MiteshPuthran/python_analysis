The Board of Trustees and staff of Carnegie Hall celebrate the life of our friend, the legendary photographer Bill Cunningham. For decades, Bill was an integral and beloved part of New York's cultural community, documenting the ever-changing world of fashion and the city's social scene. Bill worked and later lived in a studio above Carnegie Hall for sixty years, and he frequently could be seen working in the blocks around the Hall. In 2012, we were proud to honor him with Carnegie Hall's Medal of Excellence, saluting him for all he taught the world about fashion, philanthropy, and the joy of creativity at an event supporting the Hall's artistic and music education programs, a cause close to his heart. Ever gentle and humble, he used this moment to thank his photographic subjects, whether famous or unknown, and those who support the arts. We express our heartfelt condolences to his family and dedicated colleagues. Robert F. Smith, Chairman; Sanford I.
