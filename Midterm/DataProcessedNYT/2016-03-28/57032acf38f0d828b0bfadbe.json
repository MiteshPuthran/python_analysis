The Board of Trustees and staff of New York Blood Center (NYBC) mourn the loss of our former Trustee and friend, Nicholas Scoppetta. Nick, who served on the NYBC board from 2009 to 2015 was a remarkable individual and a true American success story, rising from the foster homes of mid-20th century New York to the highest levels of public service and philanthropic achievement. From prosecuting crime in the Manhattan DA's office and rooting out corruption with the Knapp Commission, to heading New York City's Child Welfare Agency and Fire Department, Nick's lifetime of service to those in need will never be forgotten. In particular, Nick's leadership of the FDNY in the wake of the September 11th attacks are now a central part of our city's history. As Fire Commissioner and later as a NYBC Trustee, Nick was instrumental in expanding the deep partnership between the FDNY and NYBC, including our organizations' bone marrow donation programs, with FDNY members now making up the largest group of bone marrow and stem cell donors. Nick's leadership, friendship and, most importantly, his example, have inspired our organization, and will continue to inspire us for years to come. To his wife, Susan, and to his children and grandchildren, we send our love and deepest sympathies. Howard P. Milstein, Chairman; Christopher D. Hillyer, MD, President and CEO 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-03-28T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  SCOPPETTA, NICHOLAS"}, "snippet": "SCOPPETTA--Nicholas.
