Died on May 21, 2016 in Westwood, Massachusetts at the age of 92, after a life devoted to her family and the important communities of her life. She died in her sleep with family present after a period of decline. Born in New York City, Sue was the daughter of Helen and Louis Carreau.

Sue and Carl raised a family of five children in Ridgewood, New Jersey, then moved to Manhattan where they lived for thirty-two years. During her busy years in Ridgewood and continuing through the first decade of this century, Sue served on a number of boards and organizations in addition to her active role as wife and mother. She was a trustee of the Ridgewood Public Library, and then the New York Public Library where she helped to launch significant fundraising and other innovative initiatives. She served for many years as a trustee of Wellesley College where she led numerous fundraising efforts. Carl and Sue have been longtime summer residents and maintained a home on Nantucket Island.
