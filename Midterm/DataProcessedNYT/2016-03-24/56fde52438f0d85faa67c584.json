He was born in New York City on January 5, 1920, and he grew up in Pleasantville, New York. He was the son of John William Frost, a lawyer in New York, mayor of Pleasantville, and long a board member of Bowdoin College, and Christina Gurlitz Frost, a member of the Harper publishing family. Steve Frost graduated from Bowdoin College in 1942. He was a hard working and loyal alumnus of the college and a proud member of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity. He was a generous supporter of the Bowdoin College Museum of Art and the Bowdoin International Music Festival. During World War II Steve Frost served in the United States Army Air Corps as a crew member on B-29 aircraft. He was awarded two Distinguished Flying Crosses for bravery in action over enemy territory. After the war, Steve Frost entered the field of banking in New York City. He had season tickets to the Metropolitan Opera, was a member of the University Club of New York for over fifty years, and enjoyed restoring old houses, including Tiverton, the sea captain's house in Topsham, Maine which his great-great-grand father purchased in 1837. He retired in 1995 as a Trust Officer and Vice President at Citibank Corporation in Manhattan. Steve Frost was an avid sailor and won several regattas in Casco Bay during his college years. He was a member of the Cruising Club of America. He crossed the Atlantic in a 35-foot sailboat and then sailed around Sweden and Great Britain. Other sailing adventures took him to the coast of Labrador, to the French Islands of St. Pierre et Miquelon, to the British West Indies, and along the Atlantic coast from New York to Nova Scotia. Maine was always his favorite cruising ground. He often sailed with young family members, who learned to share his love of wind and sea. Steve Frost was predeceased by his brothers and sisters-in-law William, Marjorie, Hunter, and Carolyn. He is survived by his nieces and nephews Marjorie, Richard, Christina, Clifford, Sherry, Daniel, Kathryn, William, and Juliana, and by his grandnieces and grand nephews George, Karen, Sarah, Alexander, Sarah, Elizabeth, and Kaleb. A memorial will be held in Brunswick in June. The family can be contacted at StevensFrost1920@ gmail.com.
