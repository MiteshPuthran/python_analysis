The Brain & Behavior Research Foundation, formerly the National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression (NARSAD), deeply mourns the passing of its visionary leader and President Emeritus, Constance E. Lieber. Connie, who served as President of the Foundation from 1989 to 2007, felt that research was the best avenue to find meaningful and lasting solutions to alleviate the suffering caused by mental illness. In her role as President Emeritus, she continued to offer her vision and guidance to the Foundation on a regular basis. Connie, along with her husband Stephen, passionately believed in the need to seed the field of neuropsychiatric research with as many talented scientists as possible to make a substantive impact on the broad spectrum of mental health research, which she fervently understood holds our best hope for ending the immense suffering caused by mental illness. Since 1980, Connie and Steve have served as extraordinary philanthropic supporters and leading public advocates of schizophrenia and depression research. Connie worked tirelessly for the cause and grew our grants program to a total of $342 million and was helpful to so many families who were desperately seeking help for their children. We recognize that she enhanced the lives of so many through her work for Brain & Behavior Research Foundation and by supporting scientists throughout the world and have the deepest gratitude to both Connie and Steve. Their generosity in supporting research on mental illness is a great model for all of us. Our deepest sympathies to Connie's beloved husband Steve, their daughter Janice, their son Sam and daughter-in-law Mary, their grandson, and to all of their loved ones. Connie was our leader and guiding light, providing inspiration and motivation to all who ever had the honor and privilege of knowing and working with her.
