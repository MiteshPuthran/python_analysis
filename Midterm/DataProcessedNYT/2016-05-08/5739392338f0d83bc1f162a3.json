Born on July 28, 1923, she lived an extraordinary life, growing up in Southampton, New York, with her parents, George Inness Hartley and Agnes de Montpellier Hartley, who predeceased her, as did her brother George. Her sister Marguerite (Bebs) survives in New York City. Barbara was a direct descendant of 19th century painter George Inness. Barbara went to Foxcroft School in Middleburg, Virginia, graduating in 1941, and went on to become a housemother and secretary to the founder of Foxcroft, Charlotte Haxall Noland, a dear friend and mentor. In fact, Foxcroft honored Barbara just this past month with its Distinguished Alumna Award. Barbara and James Couper Lord were married in Southampton in 1948 at St. Andrew's Dune Church, to which she and her family were devoted. They moved to Buffalo, NY, where she raised her family for over 30 years and where their four children were born: James Couper Lord, Jr. (deceased), Mary-Louise Lord Gillespie (husband David), Barbara Hartley Lord Edwards (husband Jim), and Ruth Lord (deceased). In Buffalo, Barbara served on the Boards of Buffalo General Hospital and Elmwood Franklin School, was an active member of Trinity Church and was President of the Garrett Club. Barbara and Couper retired to Southampton in 1980 where she continued her community work. She was President of the Southampton Nursing Home, a position she held for more than twenty-five years, was devoted to St. Andrew's Dune Church, where she served as head of the Altar Guild until she retired at ninety years of age and was appointed Trustee Emeritus, and was President of the Southampton Garden Club, for which she supervised numerous flower competitions and presided at a Garden Club of America zone meeting on the very day that her fifth granddaughter was born. Upon retiring from the Southampton Garden Club, she was honored to receive the Garden Club of America's Medal of Merit in recognition of her \"inspirational and wise leadership\". For many years Barbara served as an active member of the Village Improvement Association of Southampton, a local organization founded even before the incorporation of Southampton Village. A beloved mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother, she taught her children life's lessons of compassion for others and working within one's community. Her 'understanding heart' and empathy for the less fortunate was a gift she bequeathed to everyone about her, regardless of where she lived. Barbara is also survived by five granddaughters, whom she called her \"pearls\"--Hartley Gillespie Wenger, Lorrie Edwards, Eleanor Gillespie Strumolo, Caroline Cook Edwards, Courtney Matson Edwards--and six great-grandchildren--Noah, Walter, Henry, Jack, Sophie, and Lily--with all of whom she celebrated her 92nd birthday. Barbara Hartley Lord guided her family, relatives, and countless friends in their accomplishments, inspiring everyone to make the world a better place. All of them loved her deeply and will dearly miss her. God rest her blessed soul. A memorial service will be held in July at St. Andrew's Dune Church in Southampton. In lieu of flowers, donations in her memory may be made to St. Andrew's Dune Church, St. John's Church in Southampton, or the J. Couper Lord, Jr., Dialysis Fund at Southampton Hospital. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-05-08T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  LORD, BARBARA STUART HARTLEY (BOBBIE)"}, "snippet": "LORD--Barbara Stuart Hartley (Bobbie), age 92, passed away peacefully on Saturday, April 30, 2016 with her family beside her.
