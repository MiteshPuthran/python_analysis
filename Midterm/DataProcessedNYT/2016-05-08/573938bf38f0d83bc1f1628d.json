Our Dad, grandfather and great-grandfather, Dr. Bernard Weiss, died peacefully surrounded by family in New York on May 3, 2016 at the age of 93. Born to Dr. Samuel and Ella Weiss on February 9, 1923 in New York, NY, Bernie became known in his family, the Horowitz-Margareten Family of matzoh bakers, as \"Uncle Doctor.\" Bernie was beloved for his compassion and warmth. He practiced old fashioned, hands-on medicine, having learned from working with his father, also a doctor. He charged patients whatever they could afford to pay. Bernie's entire immediate family served in World War II, including his two brothers, his father and even his mother, who headed the local Manhattan Red Cross office. He enlisted in the United States Army Air Force before he was 18 years old. After the War, Bernie attended New York Medical College on the GI Bill. He loved his family and enriched their lives with his gentle manner and great sense of humor. The love of his life, his wife of 51 years Doris, sadly predeceased him in 2003. During summers in Atlantic Beach, his joy was gardening and barbecuing for family and friends - smoked capon was the family favorite. Bernie was loved by many and will be missed deeply by all who knew him. He is survived by his daughter Wendy and son-in-law Judd Meltzer, his daughter Cathy Zises, grandchildren Samantha and Jonathan Firestone, Joshua and Ali Meltzer, Aaron and Blake Zises, Samuel Zises and fiance Cassie Shulman, Benjamin Zises and Natalie Zises, great-grandchildren Charlotte and Hudson Firestone, sister-in-law Marie Rosen, nephews and nieces Jonny and Caroline Rosen, and Billy and Suzy Rosen. He also leaves behind a brother Jerome, many cousins and other nieces and nephews. Marie Rosen holds a most special place in his heart. She was like a sister, especially since Doris passed away. Shira Levin has been an esteemed extended member of the family. We thank her for her sage counsel, and most importantly, her love. The family thanks Ketty Suarez for her many years of devoted service. With her sister Eloise, they took the best care of Dr. Weiss. The family will have a private service and funeral. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-05-08T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  WEISS, DR"}, "snippet": "WEISS--Dr. Bernard.
