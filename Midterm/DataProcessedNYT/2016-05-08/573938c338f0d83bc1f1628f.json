She was born in Shanghai in 1927 to Chang (Han) Siang-mei and Chang Hsin-hai, a scholar and China's ambassador to Czechoslovakia, Poland and Portugal from 1933-37. She spent her early childhood in Eastern Europe. She began studying the piano at age eight in Warsaw and continued her studies in Los Angeles, where her family moved in 1941. Mrs. Chou made her concert debut with Leopold Stokowski and the Hollywood Bowl Symphony during her senior year of high school, and later moved to New York City to study with Olga Samaroff at The Juilliard School on a fellowship. In 1956, she received grants to perform in Europe, where she studied with Walter Gieseking and Marguerite Long, and gave recitals in England, France, and Germany, where the Hamburg Evening Newspaper called her \"...altogether an amazing pianist and musical talent.\" She married Chou Wen-chung in 1962 and retired from performing to care for their two sons. Her passion for flowers later led to a second career as a floral designer. Her arrangements caught the attention of the Parsons School of Design where she was invited to teach Parson's first class in floral design in 1979. For twenty-five years, she taught both Western and Ikebana styles, and the Floral Design program became one of Parsons's most popular certificate programs. She was former president of the New York Chapter of the Ohara School of Ikebana, and a member of Ikebana International. Yi-an is survived by her husband, sons Luyen and Sumin, daughters-in-law Rachel and Kiersten, and three grandchildren. She was predeceased by her brother, David P. Chang. Her laughter, friendship and joie-de-vivre are missed dearly by all who knew and loved her. Donations in Yi-an's memory can be made to the Visiting Nurse Service of New York or Doctors Without Borders. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-05-08T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  CHOU, YI, AN"}, "snippet": "CHOU--Yi-an, wife of composer Chou Wen- chung, passed away peacefully at home on April 12, 2016 after a short battle with pancreatic cancer.
