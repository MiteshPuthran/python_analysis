Ms. Cooke had studied and worked in the academic world in New York from her freshman year at Barnard College until four years ago, when she retired to Kendal on Hudson. She was 84 years old. Ms. Cooke was born in Boston, child of Paul Birdsall, a historian and U.S. foreign service officer, and Helen Grew Birdsall. Her older brother, Paul Birdsall, operates Horsepower Farm in Penobscot, Maine, a project where prospective farmers seek internships to live and farm there without electricity. After graduating from Milton Academy in Massachusetts and Barnard in 1953, Bridie, as she was known, worked as a secretary at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism. She earned a master's degree and an Ed.D. at Yeshiva University in New York and began teaching at SUNY and CUNY, where she helped to prepare students for college work. Her career was principally invested in teaching and coaching struggling students in grade school and high school, first at the Ramaz Modern Orthodox School on the Upper East Side in New York and then, from 1987 to 2001, at Columbia Grammar and Preparatory on the Upper West Side. She also had an independent practice, and was widely sought by parents. She married twice and had no children. But her understanding of the young was strong. Margo Potter, the dean at Columbia Prep when Ms. Cooke was there, said, \"She could reach children the way no one else could. She was the teacher they always came back to see after they had been graduated. She was much beloved.\" Rhoda Weyr of Boothbay, Maine, formerly a literary agent in New York, said that her daughter, Garret Freymann-Weyr, now a published author, had been led out of her youthful tangles with spoken and written language by Ms. Cooke. \"Garret really loved her,\" Ms. Weyr said, \"and when she came in the door problems began to lessen.\" Ms. Cooke retired from Columbia Prep in the summer of 2001. However, on September 11, she hurried back to the school to make sure that her pupils got home safely. \"I just felt I had to be there for them, \" she told an associate. Her marriages to Frank Pulliam and Jack Cooke, both of whom she met at Columbia, ended in divorce. Her sister, Jessie, died earlier. There is no funeral; she willed her body to medicine. A memorial service is being planned. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-05-08T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  COOKE, BRIDGET BIRDSALL"}, "snippet": "COOKE--Bridget Birdsall, a noted specialist in teaching reading to children with learning disabilities, died in Sleepy Hollow, NY, on April 18.
