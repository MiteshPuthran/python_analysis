With great sadness we mourn the loss of Lowell Pollack on the evening of March 11, 2016, beloved husband of 56 years to Judith, devoted and proud dad to Scott Pollack (Dr. Rachel Sheffet) and Dr. Debra Pollack (Dr. Daniel Wollman), and adoring papa to his bright and beautiful granddaughters, Joanna and Caroline Wollman. He is also survived by his loving sister, Barbara Rochford (Donald) and his nieces, Lynn and Laura Rochford. His life was devoted to family, education, music, travel, cultural events, and community service.

He was a social studies teacher, supervisor, and principal in the New York City schools, a Manhattanville College teacher, and also taught social studies in Hartsdale, NY. He was an accomplished musician, piano man, as both a performer and teacher. After retiring from the New York City school system, he and Judith were tireless community servants, delivering Meals-on-Wheels in White Plains, volunteering with The Westchester Philharmonic, and mentoring many area young people.
