He was a World War II veteran, Mad Man, and devoted husband and father, who succumbed to Alzheimer's after a 12-year dignified struggle. An exemplar of the Greatest Generation, he was raised on a farm in Ohio, graduated from Ohio Wesleyan on scholarship, enlisted in the Army in 1943, and fought on the Western Front throughout Germany, receiving the Silver Star, Bronze Star and Purple Heart before his honorable discharge in 1945. He moved to Connecticut in 1956, embarking on a 33-year career on the creative side with J. Walter Thompson in Manhattan. During his tenure at Thompson he helped develop the \"Built Ford Tough\" campaign and pioneered broadcast shoots in California. He was the most selfless of men, active in the community post-retirement, while caring for an ailing spouse for years. Survivors include his son Christopher Bret and daughter Rosalind Anne, both of Manhattan, and three grandchildren, Margot, Victoria and Amanda. His courage, dignity, sacrifice for others, vitality, kindness, and extraordinary decency are treasured by all who knew him. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-01-31T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  WALRATH, DALE ROBERT"}, "snippet": "WALRATH--Dale Robert, of Manhattan, NY and formerly Wilton, CT, died on December 31, 2015 at home, at the age of 94.
