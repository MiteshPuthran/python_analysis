Under the aegis of LMC, he managed the creation of Shore Hill, a rent subsidized apartment complex for senior citizens and later Harbor Hill, another facility for the elderly. He oversaw the development of Lutheran Augustana Center for Extended Care and Rehabilitation adjacent to Lutheran Medical Center and established Health Plus PHSP, provider of community based health and medical services.
