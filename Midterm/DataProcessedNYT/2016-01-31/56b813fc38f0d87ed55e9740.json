Robert. Age 79, died January 14, 2016, of complications of Parkinson's Disease in Charlotte, NC. Born and raised in New York City, Bob was a graduate of Manhattan's Stuyvesant High School and went on to attend the University of Pennsylvania where he was a member of the Sigma Chi Fraternity and the Sphinx Senior Society, the oldest and most prestigious honor society of the University of Pennsylvania. Upon his graduation from Penn in 1958, he went on to earn his Juris Doctorate degree from New York University's School of Law and was a captain in the United States Coast Guard. Mr. Johnson practiced law in New York City before finding his true calling on Wall Street. Mr. Johnson's career began at Kuhn Loeb which later merged with Lehman Brothers in 1977. He was a partner at Lehman Brothers which was the pinnacle of his work life. He absolutely loved the camaraderie of his Lehman partners and associates and retired shortly after the \"Great House of Lehman\" merged with Shearsonmerican Express in 1984. In the ensuing years he pursued business ventures, was active in various charities and loved following his grandchildren's sporting adventures. A lifelong New Yorker, Bob moved to Charlotte, NC to be closer to his two daughters and his grandchildren. He is survived by his son Hal Johnson of Mill Valley, CA and Telluride, CO, his daughters, Brooks Johnson and Jennifer Miller of Charlotte, NC and his eight grandchildren: Reilly and Summer Johnson, Chase and Dylan Johnson, Mitchell Morrow and Cole, Cade and Cameron Miller. He is also survived by his sister Carole Bayer of Tucson, AZ and his many relatives in Gothenburg, Sweden. No services are planned but the family will come together to celebrate his life this summer per his request. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-01-31T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Memorials  JOHNSON, J.
