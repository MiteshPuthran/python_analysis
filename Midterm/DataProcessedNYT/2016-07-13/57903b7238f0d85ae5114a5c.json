He was always well-informed about the needs of a television media center and how it could best serve the community. His in-depth media experience combined with his commitment to education, human rights and community development, equipped him with a wealth of ideas and resources that he willingly shared with other BronxNet board members, staff, producers, students and others for the betterment of the Bronx community. BronxNet Chairman Paul T. Gentile stated: \"The entire BronxNet family mourns the death of Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, a board member for the past 25 years, whose service to our country and his community has been extraordinary. An educator and a World War II pilot with the Tuskegee Airmen, Roscoe C. Brown leaves a legacy of integrity, wisdom and courage in serving his fellow man. BronxNet celebrates and salutes the life of this great man who is impossible to replace.
