She was 77. Judi was an amazing mother, grandmother, sister, and woman. She enjoyed gardening, reading, painting, sculpting, music and building and fixing things. For a small person, Judi had a huge heart and always opened up her home and her heart to help others. After Hurricane Sandy, she had many displaced people stay with her for extended periods of time and never felt like it was too much; instead, she always said that she wished they would stay longer since she really enjoyed being with them and helping them. Judi was born to Abraham and Rose Shereff on June 18, 1938 in New York City and raised in Forest Hills, NY. She was preceded in death by her parents. Judi is survived by her brother and sister-in-law Richard and Susan Shereff; daughter Helaine Harte and son-in-law David Rhode, her sons and daughters-in-law Douglas and Ronni Harte and Jonathan and Belynda Harte; and the pride of her life, her grandchildren, Alex and Haleigh Harte and Tyler, Casey and Rebecca Rhode. Judi loved all animals. After being a teacher and raising her children, she worked at Turtle Back Zoo in West Orange, NJ, and spent many years rescuing and rehabilitating injured and orphaned wild animals and birds. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to The Turtle Back Zoo in Judi's honor.
