A native New Yorker who loved the City-its parks, museums, concert halls and people, she lived with her father, Dr. Burrill B. Crohn, after her parents divorced when she was 12. Her brother, the late Dr. Eduard B. Crohn, lived with their mother, Lucile Pels Crohn, in Europe. Mrs. Dickler met her husband-to-be, the late Gerald Dickler, when they were in their mid-teens. He was already attending Columbia College; she went to Barnard College for two years before dropping out to help support them while he began practicing law. She was librarian and book review editor, as well as a board member, at Citizens Housing and Planning Council of New York. She also served as president of The Burrill B. Crohn Research Foundation at Mount Sinai Hospital. But her greatest passion was philanthropy. She and her husband made large donations to institutions they both loved: the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the New York Public Library, the 92nd Street Y, UJA and Planned Parenthood. They also planned gifts to other city institutions. She leaves three daughters, Abby Pratt of West Stockbridge, Massachusetts and Squirrel Island, Maine, and her husband, Larry Pratt; Jane Dickler Lebow of New York City and Susan Dickler of New York City and West Tisbury, Massachusetts, and her husband, Sig Van Raan. She had four grandchildren, Sam Pratt, Kate Lebow, Dr. Robert Pratt and Emily Hoppe; three stepgrandchildren, Jackson, Sofie and Zoe Van Raan, and four great-grandchildren, Lucy and Owen Pratt and Naomi and Jacob Lawrence. There will be no funeral. A gathering of family and friends is planned in the future. Donations in her memory may be made to The Burrill B. Crohn Research Foundation at Mount Sinai Medical Center or Citizens Housing and Planning Council. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-01-03T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  DICKLER, RUTH CROHN"}, "snippet": "DICKLER--Ruth Crohn, 102, died Thursday, December 31, at home of natural causes.
