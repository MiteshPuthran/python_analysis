Died December 31, 2015, two days after her 100th birthday. Generous, gracious and beautiful, she lost her beloved husband, Irving, in 1996, just short of their 59th Wedding Anniversary. She is survived by her children, Anne Davis and Peter (both widowed), grandchildren Ariel Morvan, David and Zoe, and three great-grandchildren, Eleanor, Angelica and Benjamin. Adele studied dramatic arts at NYU, acted briefly, and was passionate about music, art and travel. She loved her home in New York and a second home in Cannes, France, in which places she brought family and friends together. While her children were growing up in Scarsdale, NY, she was an officer of the PTA, served as co-leader of a Girl Scout troop and hosted a foreign exchange student, Delcia Bence Rusk, to whom she remained close all her life. In a brief reprise of her acting career, she played Mrs. Frank in a 1961 Scarsdale High School production of The Diary of Anne Frank in which her daughter, Anne, was played by Liza Minnelli in her acting debut. A lover of music and constant concertgoer, she was an active Board Member of Young Audiences, the Bowden International Music Festival, and the Marlboro Music Festival, which she attended for over forty years. She took great pleasure in encouraging young musicians at the beginning of their careers. The funeral is private. There will be a memorial service, the date to be announced.
