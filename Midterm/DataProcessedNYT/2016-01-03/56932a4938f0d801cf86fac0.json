The Foundation for Art and Preservation in Embassies (FAPE) is profoundly saddened by the loss of Ellsworth Kelly. Revered and respected throughout the world, we will be forever grateful for his generosity, for the works he gave so enthusiastically to our Foundation, and for his commitment to FAPE's mission. From a sketch on a paper napkin came the design of two magnificent wall sculptures for the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, which greet more than 2,000 Chinese visa applicants daily, employing the colors in our two countries' flags to honor the relationship between the U.S. and China. In Berlin, Ellsworth watched as the 40- foot-high 'Berlin Totem' he created for the U.S. Embassy soared through the air to be placed in its courtyard garden. His extraordinary lithograph, 'Leaves,' adorns the walls of 50 U.S. embassies; and he contributed to our Collection at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, as well as our millennium Gift To The Nation. He also donated the actual award that we present annually to the recipient of the Leonore and Walter Annenberg Award for Diplomacy through the Arts; the first honoree was Justice Stephen Breyer, who collaborated with Ellsworth on his site- specific installation at the John Joseph Moakley Courthouse in Boston. Ellsworth's last gift to FAPE was the establishment of an endowment, entitled the Ellsworth Kelly Fund for Preservation, to ensure FAPE's Collection is maintained in perpetuity at no cost to the government. Words cannot express how important Ellsworth was to FAPE. His gifts are a testament to his creativity, his genius and his extraordinary spirit. He will always remain in our memory, and his work will remind us of his belief in the importance of art as a means of freedom of expression and cross-cultural understanding. We send our deepest condolences to Jack Shear.
