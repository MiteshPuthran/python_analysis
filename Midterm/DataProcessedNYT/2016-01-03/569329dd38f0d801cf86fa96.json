The Checkerboard Film Foundation is very saddened at the passing of Ellsworth Kelly, seminal artist and true gentleman. In 2007, we were privileged to produce, with Jo Carole Lauder, the documentary film, \"Ellsworth Kelly: Fragments.\" Most memorably, we filmed Ellsworth in Paris as he recounted his formative experiences while living there from 1948 to 1954, and his exploration of French culture and monuments that so informed his work. He said: \"In my paintings, I am not inventing; my ideas come from constantly investigating how things look.\" They included the shadows of an arch of a bridge on the Seine (\"White Plaque: Bridge Arch and Reflection,\" 1951-55); the external chimneys on the wall of a building (\"Ormesson,\" 1950); and the long angular windows at The Museum of Modern Art, Paris (\"Window,\" his first panel painting, 1949).
