He served in the U.S. Army during World War II, then graduated from New York University (1948), Phi Beta Kappa, and entered the graduate program at Harvard (Ph.D. in English Language and Literature, 1954), where he wrote a prize-winning essay on Shakespeare. He spent his entire teaching career at Tufts University (1954-84), serving twice as chair of the Department of English. He published a number of essays in scholarly journals, a popular introduction to Shakespeare, and he served as General Editor of The Signet Classic Shakespeare, a paperback series (one play per volume) that is widely used in colleges and universities. He was also the author or co-author of several widely used textbooks-on argument (with Hugo Bedau, late of the Tufts Department of Philosophy), art, composition, drama, and literature, including \"A Short Guide to Writing about Art\" (now in its 11th edition), and \"Introduction to Literature\" (16th edition). In 1963, he and William Burto (his partner since 1952, deceased 2013) developed an interest in Japanese art, especially calligraphy, and they went on to build a collection that was exhibited in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Freer Gallery, the Harvard Art Museum, and the Museum of Fine Art, Houston. The Metropolitan exhibition was accompanied by a catalog by Miyeko Murase, \"The Written Image\" (2002), to which Barnet and Burto contributed two essays, one on collecting, the other on looking at calligraphy from a Western point of view. (After Burto's death their collection was divided among the first four of these museums.) He and Burto also wrote \"Zen Ink Paintings\" (1982) as well as several essays on Japanese art. As a teacher of English literature, he was familiar with a good deal of writing about death. Among the favorite passages he carried in his head-he could not understand why some educators disparage \"rote memory\"-were Shakespeare's \"Golden lads and girls all must/As chimney sweepers come to dust.\" and this epitaph by Sir Henry Wotton (1568-1639), \"Upon the Death of Sir Albert Morton's Wife\": \"He first deceased; she for a little tried/To live without him, liked it not, and died.\" (Barnet said, shortly after the death of his partner, that Wotton's lines came to his mind every day, and that he regretted, every day, his inability to re-enact them.) He leaves his sister-in-law Saretta Barnet, a niece and three nephews and their spouses, nine grandnephews and nieces, a great-grandnephew and niece, and his longtime friend, Morton Berman. Most of his estate was bequeathed to a scholarship fund at Tufts, in honor of his parents, Philip and Esther Barnet. By his wish there will be no services. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-01-14T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  BARNET, SYLVAN"}, "snippet": "BARNET--Sylvan, born in Brooklyn, New York, on December 11, 1926, died at home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on January 9, 2016.
