She is survived by her children, Peter A. Nitze, Andrew H. Nitze, Amanda G. Sanfilippo, and Benjamin M. Nitze; her eight grandchildren; her three great-grandchildren; and her brother John R. MacNeille, III. Sheila was born in New York in 1936 to John R. MacNeille and Cynthia Goodwin MacNeille, and grew up with her sister and brother on a sheep farm in Pittstown, New Jersey. She attended Harvard University, marrying Peter P. Nitze in 1957 as a junior, before graduating with two young boys in 1959. The family moved to New York in 1960, where Sheila became engaged with the civil rights and peace movements, working for the Kennedy campaigns and the Black Panthers. Sheila volunteered for Amnesty International and the American Friends Service Committee for many years, and later in life, for Tibet House. She was a brilliant and beautiful woman, committed to social justice, whose varied friendships spanned cultural divides. Sheila was also a poet, a dancer, and a lifelong teacher of children and young adults whose lives were not as fortunate as hers. She worked for Floating The Apple Inner City Youth Boatbuilding Project, teaching grant writing and English literature. She also taught at the Correctional Educational Consortium, tutoring students who came through rehabilitation and parole programs. Her dedication to education as a form of liberation from social injustice and poverty was tireless. Sheila will be remembered for her vibrant spirit and her extraordinary presence. She could make a stone laugh out loud. Her sharp humor and distinct style, her love of dance, and the Irish language and culture were her passion and solace in life. She will be missed and dearly remembered by her family, and by all those who encountered her resilient and powerful spirit. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-02-07T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  NITZE, SHEILA MACNEILLE"}, "snippet": "NITZE--Sheila MacNeille, age 79, died peacefully on December 26th in the home of her son Peter in Seattle surrounded by three of her children.
