Patrick Daley, Senior Vice President and Publisher, Scholastic Education, is mourned by his colleagues and friends who were honored to publish the brilliant and engaging reading programs he developed that helped transform the lives of millions of students. As a young classroom teacher in Burlington, VT, Patrick got some advice that would change his life: you must do whatever it takes to get them to read. He joined Scholastic in 1988, vowing to create the highest-quality, most engaging reading materials that would help even the most profoundly struggling readers to read with joy. Patrick was the editor of Scholastic Action magazine, which serves at-risk students and went on to develop READ 180, the premier reading intervention program for grades 3-12. His passion for helping children learn to read was his driving force. He put his heart and soul into READ 180 and other programs designed to serve the diverse populations of children who needed stories in which they could find themselves. It is thanks to Patrick Daley and his big ideas, bigger energy, and huge heart that millions of children have learned to read. His wisdom and passionate dedication to children will remain with all who knew and worked with him. Patrick is survived by his loving husband Daryl Hair and two sisters, Mary and Kathy along with extended family.
