If success can be measured by happiness, then Stan Schottland was a very successful man. He had a charmed life and in every way, the American dream. Stanley Adrian Schottland was born May 27th, 1919 in New York City to Ruth and Charles Schottland. He was predeceased by his older brother Jack. Stan attended DeWitt Clinton High School, but after his father died during his senior year, he chose to leave to go to work and help support his family. The year was 1936. Stan enlisted in the Army the day after Pearl Harbor, was promoted to Lieutenant and landed on Omaha beach in July 1944 as part of George Patton's army. He fought bravely and was wounded in action in September of that year. During his training state side, he met the love of his life Ellen Bordley Schottland in Sebring Florida. Ellen and Stan were married on December 24, 1944 in Chestertown, MD. They had three sons: Charles (Buck), Steven and Peter who they adored. Married more than sixty years, what a life they shared together. Stan and Ellen made friends all across the country where they owned homes including Bronxville, NY, Chestertown, Maryland, Rochester, NY, Gladwyne, PA, Cordillera, Colorado, Kiawah Island, SC, Hobe Sound, Florida and Naples, Florida. Soon after the war, he went back to work for Schenley Distillers where he began his career as an office boy years earlier. Stan was employed by Schenley for 27 years, including his three years while serving in the Army. With Stan's tenacious drive, he rose to the position of President of their Bourbon Division. In 1963, his career was flourishing but Stan was determined to own his own company. In 1966, he joined hands with a small bag manufacturer named American Bag and Paper located in Philadelphia and together they purchased Northern Packaging in Rochester, NY. Three years later, Stan was invited to come to Philadelphia and take over American Bag and Paper as a partner and CEO. In 1986, he bought out his partner with his three sons and grew the company to what is today American Packaging Corporation. American Packaging is one of America's largest privately owned flexible packaging companies employing over 800 families. Stan's philanthropic efforts were significant. With a passion for young talent and leadership skills, Stan founded several programs at the College of Charleston and Washington College. Another passion of Stan's was the health and well-being of children. American Packaging is one of the founding companies supporting Paul Newman's Hole in the Wall Gang Camp. While his military career was formidable, his business success quite remarkable and his charitable passions to be respected, at the end of the day, family was everything to him. Stan absolutely adored his elegant lady Ellen, his sons Buck, Steven and Peter, his 10 grandchildren and his 10 great-grandchildren. Most summers were spent on the Eastern Shore of Maryland surrounded by friends and family. In his later years after Ellen's passing, he had the blessing of companionship with a wonderful lady named Betty Flora. Stan touched so many people along the way and will be truly missed by all. God bless \" Stan the man, Dad , Grandpa and GG Pop \". A Funeral Service will be held on Sunday, February 14 at 1:00pm at St. Paul's Kent Episcopal Church, Chestertown. A visitation will be held on Saturday evening February 13 from 5:00-7:00pm at Fellows, Helfenbein, and Newnam Funeral Home 130 Speer Road Chestertown, MD 21620.
