He was born in Lancaster, PA, but was a lifelong resident of New York City and Fire Island. A graduate of Phillips Exeter Academy, Yale University (1956) and the University of Pennsylvania Law School (1959), he practiced law with Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy for a number of years, during which time he also served in the U.S. Army reserve.

He served on several non-profit boards, including Urban Stages and Plays for Living. He had a wonderful sense of humor, was a marvelous pianist and a very talented photographer, was a most loyal friend and possessed a gift for bringing people together. He had a magnificent collection of motion pictures on tape and disc, which he organized alphabetically by studio. He was a member of Holland Lodge No. 8, F. & A.M. and for a number of years was a member of The Players and The Yale Club of New York City. John is survived by his brother, Paul A.
