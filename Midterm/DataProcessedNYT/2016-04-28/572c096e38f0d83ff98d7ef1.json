Darling Dalia, You were the most beautiful woman who ever crossed the threshold of my vision. Not only were you gorgeous, you were incredibly intelligent, sensitive, kind and caring. You represented everything that any man would ever desire in a wife and partner. I thank you for having chosen to marry me and for giving me the confidence and strength to pursue our dreams together. Dalia, you were a magnificent mother, and you so nurtured our wonderful children Cary, Ashley and Tracy, providing an enduring example of the true meaning of family. Your six grandchildren Sam, Michael, Ben, Nicholas, Olivia, and Jamie adored their Grandma Didi and will hold you forever in their hearts.
