Born in New York City in 1931 to Henry and Mae Friedricks, she attended Ethical Culture Fieldston School and married Alan Baron in 1950. They had three children, Susan (Mald), Fred and John whom they raised in Scarsdale, NY. In the 70's, the ever elegant and fashionable Pat followed in her family's footsteps and founded Fashionmakers. What started out as a cottage industry in her Scarsdale home grew into a manufacturer of women's clothing for a long list of retailers, including Saks, Bergdorf Goodman and Brooks Brothers. In 1985 she married Donald Ravitch and shortly afterwards moved to San Francisco. Their gracious Russian Hill home became the gathering place for the now extended Baron/Ravitch clan. Donald passed away two years ago, after 28 years of marriage. Patricia is survived by her three children and their spouses, Susan (Lance), Fred (Nancy), John (Betsy) and her six grandchildren, Sara, Katie (Miguel), Max, Maggie, Oliver and Andrew. She will also be missed by Donald's children Amy (Bruce), Jill and John (Adisa), her step- grandchildren Emily and Henry. In lieu of flowers the family requests donations to the Alzheimer's Association. Memorial Service will be at Frank E.
