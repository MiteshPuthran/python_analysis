She was 79. Throughout her life, Josephine was a seeker of the truth and passionate about teaching the sacred dances of G. I. Gurdjieff. During the last thirty years of her life, she worked tirelessly with others to faithfully document and record these sacred dances for future generations. Her passion for spiritual search was mirrored only by her fierce loyalty and devotion to her family. She was born in in Berlin, Germany in 1936, to German Olympic medalist, Walter Flinsch and Margaret Matthews Flinsch. During World War II she lived with her mother and sister in Corrales, New Mexico. Thereafter her family moved to Princeton, New Jersey and then to New York City. Josephine trained as a classical violinist from an early age, having studied with Cellist Alexander Schneider. In 1949, Josephine went to Paris with her mother and continued her schooling. It was there she met G.I. Gurdjieff and was introduced to his teachings and sacred dances which were based on his experiences in the East. For the rest of her life she participated in and instructed others in these dances. In 1958, Josephine married Morris Llewellyn Thatcher (Lew), while he was a young officer in the United States Navy. She graduated from Barnard College that same year with a degree in French and began her teaching career at The Brearley School in New York. Josephine moved to Venezuela with her husband Lew when he got a job with the Venezuelan government. All three of their children were born there. The family returned to the United States so Lew could complete his doctoral studies at M.I.T. While living in Massachusetts, Josephine taught elementary school at Buckingham Browne & Nichols School. They then settled for twenty years in the New York area, much of which was spent at their home in Snedens Landing. Josephine's later years were divided between Western North Carolina and Nova Scotia, Canada. At the Gaelic College, in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia she expanded her love of the violin to include Irish and Scottish fiddling. Josephine's warm and radiant presence touched and continues to touch the lives of all she met. She is survived by her husband, Lew, her three children; Christopher, Michael and Evelyn and her sister, Angela Flinsch Laignel, of West Harrison, NY.
