Beloved husband of Patricia for 46 years, father of Brian, father-in-law of Kathleen, and grandfather to James, Margaret, and John. Loving and caring uncle and cousin to many, and a friend to all. A native of New York City's Hell's Kitchen and Inwood, and longtime resident of Blauvelt, NY and Spring Lake, NJ, Jimmy was a 50 year member of Local 751, Treasurers and Ticket Sellers, and took great pride in his 30 year tenure as Head Treasurer of Times Square's TKTS booth. Working in partnership with Pat, he also owned and managed the Spring Lake Inn of Spring Lake, NJ from 1994 -2002, and following his semi-retirement spent his days following his beloved grandchildren from place to place. He was a constant fixture in the audience, on the sidelines, and wherever they would be. He loved them dearly, and they loved him. For all of his accomplishments, the most important thing, aside from his family, was his 39 year membership in Alcoholics Anonymous. Sober since December 27, 1976, he credited the principles and fellowship of the program as being key to his long-lasting sobriety. His family and friends take pride in knowing that he died as a man of dignity and honor. The family will receive guests at the Feeney Funeral Home in Ridgewood from 2-4pm and 7-9pm on Saturday, April 23 and Sunday, April 24. A Mass will be held at Our Lady of Mount Carmel R.C. Church in Ridgewood at 10am on Monday, April 25, followed by interment at Rockland Cemetery in Sparkill, NY. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Encore Community Services, 239 West 49th Street, New York, NY 10019. http://encorecommunity services.org/ 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-04-24T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  GATENS, JAMES P."}, "snippet": "GATENS--James P.,71, passed away suddenly on April 19, 2016.
