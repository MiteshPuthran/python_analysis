Beloved father, grandfather and great-grandfather, Stanley, the last survivor of ten brothers and sisters, lived a long, full and blessed life of 95 years. Raised in the Bronx, Stanley joined the Navy as a pilot and instructor during World War II. After the war, Stanley joined his brothers in the textile business. Eventually, the brothers bought Century Business Credit where Stanley served as CEO until the company was acquired by Wells Fargo Bank in 1998. Stanley lived his life with vigor and style. His philanthropic endeavors included Columbia Presbyterian, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, UJA and Park Avenue Synagogue among others. To his family he was Skipper, a name he earned as captain of the Doric, the sailboat he raced around the world. Skipper loved the outdoors, was committed to his family, and had a 74-year love affair with his wife, Doris, who died in 2014. He left a legacy of honesty, integrity and independence of spirit. He is survived by his loving children, Andrew Tananbaum and Ricki Conway, and his many grandchildren and great-grandchildren. We would like to thank the team of doctors at Columbia Presbyterian and the at-home nurses who helped maintain his quality of life until the very end.
