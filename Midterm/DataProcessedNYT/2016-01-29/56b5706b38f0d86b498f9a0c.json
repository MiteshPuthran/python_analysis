After 96 years of laughing, loving, shouting, learning, teaching, and building, Henry, the beloved patriarch of the Kibel family, passed away peacefully Wednesday night surrounded by family and friends. Henry created a wonderful life for his family and for the many others who benefited from his generosity. He graduated from Stuyvesant High School, William & Mary College and Yale University School of Architecture. He was a naval officer in the South Pacific during World War II. Henry was an architect, a builder and an artist. He built thousands of apartments in New York City. Every part of the development process carried his imprint. Henry was a master of making things-creating gave him joy. Whether he was building an apartment tower or creating illustrations that accompany the recipes of the renowned chef Andre Soltner's cookbook, Henry's passion never stopped. In addition to the building legacy he created, Henry was, in his own words, the inventor of important things: the 12\" kitchen cabinet and innovative real estate advertising- including the successful campaign for 85 John Street, 'featuring lousy views and flushing toilets.' The fancy suspender companies will sorely miss Henry, who supported their industry and whose industry supported his pants. Although he oversalted everything, he managed to live to 96. On second thought, his memory was not so great for the last 10 years, so maybe the salt was not so good. Henry is survived by his sister, three children, eight grandchildren, and many nephews and nieces. The funeral will be held on Friday, January 29 at 11:30am at Frank Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue. We will sorely miss him.
