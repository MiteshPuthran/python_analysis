He was born in Philadelphia, PA on February 26, 1986 to Thomas B. O'Brien, Jr. and Federica F. O'Brien. Brennan graduated from Moorestown High School and went on to receive a Bachelor of Science from the University of Richmond. He was married to Allison Sottile on November 8, 2014 in Lake Placid, NY.

Brennan is survived by his loving wife Allison, his parents Tom and Freddi O'Brien and sister Alexandra Lunkenheimer.
