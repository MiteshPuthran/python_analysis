He was Chairman Emeritus of Colgate University's Board of Trustees, having served as chairman of the board from 1979-1985. This is a position that was also held by his beloved stepfather Wellington Powell. For his extraordinary volunteer work at Colgate, Mr. Drake received the Ernest T. Stewart Award from the Council for Advancement and Support of Education, the organization's highest award, presented by the U.S. Secretary of Education in 1983. He and his wife, Shirley Grant Drake (who predeceased him in 1993) established the Drake Chair in the Humanities in 1988 and the Library and Scholarship Funds in 1990. In 2004 Mr. Drake and his wife Patricia van Eybergen Drake also established another scholarship fund. As a business leader, Mr. Drake was a life-long champion of the value of having a liberal arts education, which he believed taught critical and independent thinking. Additionally he felt strongly that colleges should encourage students to become bi-lingual in order to be truly prepared to work in our modern interconnected world. During World War II Mr. Drake served as a pilot, rising to the rank of Lt. Colonel in the Air Force Reserve and received the Air Medal and Oak Leaf Cluster while in the 20th Troop Carrier Squadron in the 6th Air Force. While in the South Atlantic Theater he flew two five star Generals: Hap Arnold and George C. Marshall to visit air bases. He flew the Brazilian chief of staff General Gaspar Dutra (later president of Brazil) on a tour of the European Theater of Operations to review Brazilian troops. He also flew the Bob Hope Troupe on an entertainment tour of the 6th Air Force. Mr. Drake was born in Kansas City, MO in 1919. He finished growing up in Caldwell, NJ. He lived in New York, New Hampshire, Los Angeles and Connecticut. In retirement he divided his time between homes in Carpinteria, CA and Wickenburg, AZ. Mr. Drake was a person who would take on challenging projects and bring a combination of imagination, perseverance and dynamic leadership. Those who worked with him benefitted from his willingness to set very high goals and create a strong team spirit. At the same time he adhered to high moral standards, explaining to his teams that, \"We're Boy Scouts.\" All who got to know him were blessed by his personal warmth, loyalty and very active sense of humor. He greatly enjoyed people and made deep enduring friendships wherever he lived and worked. Many of those whose lives he touched would attest to the fact that, due to his interest and encouragement, he changed their lives. While, in his last years he was not blessed with good health, his love of life and for the people around him overcame all his adversities. He remained to the end a cheerful and delightful companion in life and will be sorely missed. Mr. Drake was married to Shirley Grant, daughter of William T. Grant, from 1943 until her death in 1993. He married Patricia Van Eybergen of Mexico City, Mexico in 1995 and is not only survived by her but also by his sons Ted, Jeffrey (Barbara Smith) and Andy, as well as by three grandchildren, two great- grandchildren, his brother Donald Powell, along with many nieces and nephews and the children and grand- children of his stepfamily. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-06-19T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  DRAKE, HARRINGTON \"DUKE.\" PASSED AWAY AT HIS HOME IN WICKENBURG"}, "snippet": "DRAKE--Harrington \"Duke.\" Passed away at his home in Wickenburg, AZ on June 7th.
