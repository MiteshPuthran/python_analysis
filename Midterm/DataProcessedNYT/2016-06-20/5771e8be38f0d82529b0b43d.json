He had been an active and well-known member of his community for many years. Myron was born in Ardmore, OK on June 25, 1923, the son of the late Robert and Adeline Ledbetter. Myron was a freshman at Oklahoma State when World War II began. During the summer of 1942 he earned a commission as an ensign in the United States Navy and was assigned to LST 947. His ship was part of the invasion of Okinawa and occupation of Japan. Upon his discharge Myron returned to Oklahoma to finish his studies in plant biology at Oklahoma State, then realizing he needed further education in his chosen field of plant biology, went to UC Berkeley for a Master's Degree. Myron worked as a Research Assistant at Boyce Thompson Institute in Yonkers, NY while pursuing his PhD work in botany at Columbia University. To further his specialized work on the plant cell research, Myron then went to Rockefeller Institute to work with Dr. Keith Porter to develop new techniques on the electron microscope. A year later to continue his research, he went to Harvard University with Dr. Porter's team. Working with the electron microscope, Myron and Dr. Porter published many new important findings, ultimately resulting in the publication of an atlas of plant cells \"Introduction to the Fine Structure of Plant Cells.\" Finally in 1965 Myron accepted a position as a cell biologist and ultimately senior cell biologist at Brookhaven National Laboratory where he stayed until his retirement in 1989. Myron was a highly respected cell biologist and well known for his work on the electron microscope. He and Dr. Porter published research in 1963 on the discovery of a new organelle in plant cells, the microtubule, which initiated a whole new area of plant cell biology research, a discovery so significant that fifty years later the July 2013 issue of the scientific journal \"Plant Journal\" devoted its entire issue to the importance of this finding. Myron, and another colleague Robert Dell, invented a self-cleaning aperture to correct a problem with the electron microscope, a gad- get which saved hours of down time of the microscope and is still widely in use. Myron was elected as the president of the Electron Microscopy Society of America for 1978. That Society also awarded him the Distinguished Scientist Award, Biological Sciences, for 1996. Myron possessed a keen inquiring intellect and had a seemingly encyclopedic knowledge of and interest in many areas. He was particularly interested in social justice and human rights and established the Myron C. Ledbetter Diversity Scholarship at Oklahoma State University. In 2000 he was given the OSU Distinguished Alumni Award. Myron enjoyed theater and classical music, travel, reading, book discussion groups, entertaining and dining out. He and his life partner of over 55 years, John D'Aquila who predeceased him in 2014, had been subscribing members of the Metropolitan Opera and the Roundabout Theater Company for many years. In Port Jefferson they particularly enjoyed Theatre Three. Myron was a co-founder of OLLI (Osher Lifelong Learning Institute) at Stony Brook University and participated in many of its programs. He became interested in stained glass and created many beautiful imaginative pieces, some even based on his own microscopic plant cell enlargements. He was an active member of the memoirs group and continued as long as his health permitted. Myron traveled extensively. He and John had friends everywhere, including the group with whom he served in WWII. In 2012 Myron and John were married, an event which gave great joy to their family and friends. Myron was predeceased by his brother Robert. He is survived by a sister-in-law Marcia Ledbetter and by a cousin Margaret Garland, and by many loving nieces and nephews and by a host of lifelong friends. Myron Ledbetter was a gracious and kind man and a thoughtful friend. He will be greatly missed. Memorial donations in Myron's name may be made to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, NY, NY 10065. Expressions of condolence may be sent to the family of Myron C. Ledbetter c/o www. obdavisportjefferson.com A celebration of Myron's life will be held on June 26, at the Belle Terre Community Center, Cliff Road at 11am. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-06-20T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  LEDBETTER, MYRON C"}, "snippet": "LEDBETTER--Myron C. died at his home in Belle Terre, NY on June 1, at the age of 92.
