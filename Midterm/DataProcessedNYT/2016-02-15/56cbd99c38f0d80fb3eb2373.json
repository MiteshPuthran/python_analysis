Don was a loving husband to his wife of 55 years, Betty Jane, and a devoted father to Rob, Greg and Alison, and their spouses Carolyn, Jodi and Jonathan. He adored his six grandchildren, Talia, Sasha, Emma, Benjamin, Julia and Eli. He eagerly followed his children's and grandchildren's pursuits and celebrated every family event. He is also survived by his sister, Roberta Rosenfeld of Orange County, CA. Don grew up in Elizabeth, NJ, was a graduate of Columbia University and earned a law degree at the University of West Virginia. Don practiced law and then held an array of business positions that showcased his people skills, deal-making abilities, keen intellect and wit. He was devoted to Judaism (a legendary Seder leader), ever curious about American history and engaged in politics since his days aiding the Kennedy campaign in New Jersey. His relentless optimism, generosity, and humor (and kibitzing) left a lasting impression on everyone who knew him. We always will love and miss him dearly. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-02-15T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  CLARICK, DONALD E."}, "snippet": "CLARICK--Donald E.,80, of Miami Beach, FL, passed away February 12, 2016, after a long, courageous battle with kidney and heart disease.
