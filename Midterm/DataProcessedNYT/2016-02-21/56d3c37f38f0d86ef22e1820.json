She grew up in Rye Neck, N.Y., attending Bellows High, Wells College, and later New York's Fashion Institute. Sheila was one of the visionary women in the fashion business, instrumental in changing the scope of women's roles and competing at the highest levels. In the 50's and 60's she handled all press and publicity for fashion company Mr. Mort. She was one of the pioneers in the industry for licensing European designers notably Nina Ricci. Ms. Cole conceived new concepts in thematic retail store design. Stores such as Metro done as a subway station and Airport designed like a Boeing 747 were harbingers of a new trend in fashion presentation. From fashion she moved onto publicity for the Public Theater in New York. Eventually Sheila easily moved onto interior design with a very reserved and tasteful talent. In Sonoma, CA she fell in love with the town and it's history, eventually becoming chair of the area's State Park Docents and chair of the League of Historic Preservation as well. Ms. Cole formed a committee to place a statue of Sonoma's founder General Mariano Vallejo in the town's historic plaza. Four sons, Ronald, Tristan, Michael, and James Israel, seven grandchildren, and two great grandchildren survive Sheila. A memorial service will take place at a later date to be announced in the springtime. In lieu of flowers, the family is requesting that donations be sent to I.S.I. (Inquiring Systems, Inc.) with a notation in the memo line for General Vallejo at P.O.
