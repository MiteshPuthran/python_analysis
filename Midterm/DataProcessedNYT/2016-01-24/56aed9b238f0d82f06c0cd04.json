He was 57. The son of Dr. Joseph R. Washington, Jr. and the late Sophia M. Washington, Bryan was born in Boston, Massachusetts. During his formative years, Bryan lived in numerous towns and cities in Wisconsin, Virginia, California, and Pennsylvania, where he attended the University of Pennsylvania. At UPenn, Bryan was a Benjamin Franklin Scholar; he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree (with honors) in General Literature in 1980. UPenn served as a catalyst for Bryan's graduate studies, which led him to complete his Master's Degree in English Literature at Christ Church, Oxford University in 1982 through Penn's Thouron Award, a British-American exchange program. Bryan received his second Master's Degree in English and American Language at Harvard University in 1985. He was also a Minority Prize Fellow from 1982-1987. Bryan received his Ph.D. in English and American Literature and Language from Harvard in 1989. Bryan launched his academic career as an instructor at Lafayette College in 1987 and was promoted to Assistant Professor in 1989. He served as a Ford Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow at Princeton University from 1991-1992. In 1994, Bryan was promoted to Associate Professor with full tenure. Bryan's scholarly work includes the publication of a book entitled \"The Politics of Exile: The Ideology in Henry James, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and James Baldwin\" in 1995. The book was well received and widely cited. It is considered by many to be one of the first works to position James Baldwin alongside white canonical American authors. Bryan also authored several articles and reviews, including: \"Paris Blues(s),\" an essay on James Baldwin; and \"WASP Mischief: Martha Stewart and the Racial Status Quo.\" He was in the process of writing two books before he became ill. Throughout his career at Lafayette, which spanned over a quarter century, Bryan received numerous honors, including the Student Government Superior Teaching Award in 1989-1990 and 1992-1993, which is rare for a professor to receive twice. Bryan delivered presentations at Lafayette on topics such as \"Blacks in Popular Culture\" and \"Black Writers in the Classroom.\" In May 2014, Bryan delivered \"The Last Lecture\" to graduating seniors; this was, sadly, Bryan's last lecture and last professional engagement. The title of the lecture was: \"In the Course of It All: Life is Words;\" this honor, along with the two student government teaching awards, suggests how deeply he was loved by his students- his courses were always over-enrolled. Students described him as inspiring, exciting, funny, and extremely smart. Bryan once described his teaching in the following terms: \"If asked what I aim to accomplish in the classroom, I would say I am trying for a good conversation. For in all my courses dialogue is a primary emphasis. I enjoy lecturing, but my class presentations, generally, are designed to provoke dissuasion. Whether just beginning college work or about to finish, undergraduates (I believe) have something to teach me.\" As a resident of Doylestown, PA, Bryan's life included jazz and the American songbook as a joy, metaphor and interpretation of his many passions: writing, literary criticism, food, art, \"beautiful things,\" and, of course, Paris. During evenings, he would often play his stereo or the piano and sing to Carmen McRae, Shirley Horn or other great jazz artists, while duck was in the oven (or some other scrumptious dish) along with a plate of pate and wine at the ready, all for the evening's feast to be shared with Russell Clinton, his husband and life partner for 23 years, and, on many occasions, close friends. During his stay fighting cancer in various hospitals and healthcare facilities, Bryan often said that the rooms that he was in were \"simply awful\", and \"he wants to go out in style\" - of course his care and room assignments were, in fact, top notch! But, we all know Bryan and his desire to be surrounded by beauty. So, what did he do to dress up his room(s)? He buys a beautifully designed Simon Pearce lamp for only a brief stay. And, at Christmas, even though he was unable to eat solid foods or drink, he had a bounty of epicurean delights delivered from Dean and Deluca for him to taste and smell, including his favorite wines and brandy, all for the decadence of it all, and to celebrate his favorite holiday in abundance with his dear Russell. In addition to his husband Russell, Bryan is survived by his father, Joseph; father and mother-in-law, Bill and Ruthann; brother, David, and his partner, Christine; Russell's sister, Debbie and her children Calvin, Travis and Kiara and numerous other family members and friends. A celebration of Bryan's life will be held at 4pm, Friday, January 29, 2016 at Buckingham Friends School, 5684 York Road, Lahaska, PA.
