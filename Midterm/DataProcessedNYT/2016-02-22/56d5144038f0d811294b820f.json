A mentor to so many, a true humanitarian, a gentle and kind man, he was highly respected for his integrity and generosity, and inspired love and affection to all those who met him. As a former director at Drew University expressed: \"When he talked, everyone listened.\" Jean Gazarian joined the United Nations in 1946, when he was 24. He served first as a translator, then as an editor and, in 1959, was called to work in the Executive Office of the Secretary-General to deal with General Assembly affairs. In 1966, he became Director of the Division of the General Assembly Affairs, a position he held for 18 years. A witness to many world events, he met kings and queens, and presidents, but always remained humble. Ambassador Ahmad Kamal, Senior Fellow at the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR), told the UN News Centre: \"He was absolutely unique as a person. His knowledge, his devotion to the UN and the manner in which he inspired love and affection among thousands of UN diplomats and staff members made him a prince among men.\" While working for the General Assembly, he traveled extensively as secretary and coordinator of conferences, held in Geneva, Oslo, Vienna, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Managua, Jakarta, Guatemala, etc. He also assisted Secretary- General U Thant during his official visit in 1970 to eleven Francophone African countries, where he served as his interpreter.
