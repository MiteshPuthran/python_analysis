Known as \"Dottie\" she was preceded in death by her husband Roy Hampton Park, founder, chairman and CEO of Park Communications whose broadcast, newspaper and outdoor media conglomerate reached 25 percent of the American public when he died in 1993. Growing up in Raleigh, North Carolina, she met her husband, a graduate of North Carolina State University, on a blind date. They moved to Ithaca, New York when her husband was hired to run the ad agency for the Grange League Federation, one of the largest farm cooperatives in the world, which later became Agway. Through this Agricultural Advertising and Research agency, Dottie's entrepreneurial husband went on meet Duncan Hines at the Waldorf Astoria to co-found Hines-Park Foods with 124 companies licensed to use the gourmet Duncan Hines name on 250 products, of which the cake mix line survives today. During the launch of the Duncan Hines food line, Dottie and Roy traveled with Duncan Hines for months at a time to just about every major city in America to meet with mayors and dignitaries for Duncan Hines Days. After Proctor & Gamble approached Park and purchased the company, Mr. Park used the stock to launch into the media business. With his wife's devotion and support, and always at his side, they met and charmed legions of prospective businesses in the media field across the country. Her husband's job was to acquire properties and Dottie's job was to host the wives of the owners of the properties he acquired. Dottie constantly entertained during their travels and at home, being always the consummate southern lady, but more than once thought of as a steel magnolia. After all the years of helping her husband through his separate careers, Dottie and Roy joined Walter Cronkite and his wife, Betsy, at the Waldorf to celebrate their joint 50th wedding anniversaries. When Walter asked Dottie what her husband had given her, she proudly replied \"One thousand dollars for each year we've been married.\" To which Cronkite said \"That's all he gave you? That's awful. If you figure it out, it only comes to $2.74 a day.\" One can imagine the repercussions from that. During his career her husband was a trustee of the Museum of Broadcasting in New York City, president and treasurer of the Sales Executive Club of Greater New York, a member of the New York Athletic Club, the Cornell Club of New York, the Union League Club of New York City and owner of WPAT-FM serving the greater New York City area. Upon the death of her husband, Dottie decided to sell Park Communications in its entirety with the proceeds going to the Park Foundation that she and her husband had founded 29 years earlier. With her husband's will designating her President of the newly funded Park Foundation, Inc. It was agreed by its Board of Trustees its core mission was to fund the academic institutions with which her husband had been affiliated during his lifetime. Park Scholarships were established for four- year undergraduate programs at North Carolina State University and Ithaca College as well as graduate Roy H. Park Fellowships for MBAs at the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University, and Master's and PhD Park Fellows at the School of Media and Journalism at the University of North Carolina. Initial core grantees also included the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research in Ithaca, the only board position her husband retained until he died, and Public Broadcasting Service programming such as Nova and Nature. Under her leadership as President of the Park Foundation, Dottie's philanthropy was also spread far and wide, from the country's first no-kill animal shelter, to Ithaca College, home of the Roy H. Park School of Communications, to the Park Atrium addition to the Cornell School of Hotel Administration, and the Roy H. Park Library at the School of Media and Journalism in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. In 2003 members her son along with his son and daughter created a second foundation, Triad Foundation, Inc., which permitted both foundations to pursue the philanthropic objectives that best reflected the diverse needs of their respective Boards. To date, between the two Foundations over 2,000 students have graduated from the four Universities with full tuition paid. Since 1995 charitable grants given by both Foundations have totaled over half a billion dollars. All in all, Dottie was an ardent lover of nature, animals and mankind. Numerous people received hospitality in this transplanted Southerner's northern home. She will be missed. Surviving are her son, Roy Hampton Park, Jr. and his wife Tetlow, her daughter Adelaide Park Gomer, all of Ithaca, New York; her grandchildren: Elizabeth Park Fowler and husband Troy of Tampa, Florida, Roy Hampton Park III and his wife Laura of Charlotte, North Carolina and Alicia Park Wittink and her husband Mark of Ithaca, New York. Also surviving are nine great grandchildren: Noble Brooks Fowler, Chase Hampton Fowler, Elizabeth Sumner Park, Samantha Tetlow Fowler, Roy Hampton Park IV, Lawson Brooks Park, Cameron Parham Park, Anneke Dickson Wittink, and Mathijs August Park Wittink. A Memorial service will be held at 1:00pm on Thursday, June 30 at the First Presbyterian Church of Ithaca with a reception to follow at the Country Club of Ithaca. In lieu of flowers, contributions can be made in her memory to the SPCA of Tompkins County or the Tompkins County Public Library. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-06-26T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  PARK, DOROTHY DENT"}, "snippet": "PARK--Dorothy Dent, died quietly at her home in Ithaca, New York, on Saturday, June 18, 2016 among her family and devoted staff and nurses dedicated to her care and well-being.
