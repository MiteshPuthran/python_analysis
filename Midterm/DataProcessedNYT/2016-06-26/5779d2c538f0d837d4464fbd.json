Age 97, died on June 19 in Andover, Massachusetts, where she moved following the death of husband James A. Rousmaniere in 2004. Until her final few days, she was alert and interested in family, politics and life in general. She and her late husband were longtime residents of Oyster Bay, NY, where they raised seven sons and a daughter. Her earliest years as an Army child included three years in Germany where her father John L. Pierce (husband of Kate Bodine Stone) served in the Occupation. She met her future husband, then a young Army officer, in California during World War II. They maintained a happy marriage during which he introduced her to sailing on Long Island Sound and also during which she gracefully endured his serial candidacies for local political office; she enthusiastically supported progressive politicians at the national level, taking particular interest in the election of the nation's first black president and enthusiastically looking forward to the election of its first female president. She demonstrated an early proficiency in art, which she studied at Texas State College for Women and Auburn; to the amazement of friends, she continued to paint amid the clatter of a growing houseful of children. She was an avid reader of fiction and nonfiction, and she encouraged each of her children to keep an open and expanding mind. She leaves a sister, Isabel Ward of Indianapolis, and children John, Peter, James Jr., David, Joe, Ned, Arthur and Kate and their spouses and children.
