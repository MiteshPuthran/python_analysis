Rena Berliner, beloved wife of the late Moses Berliner, passed away peacefully on June 21, 2016, after a brief illness. She was surrounded by her family, daughter Rochelle Berliner, son Sherwin Borsuk and his wife, Ruth, and her cherished grandchildren Declan Kurant, Ethan Borsuk and wife, Maritza and Amaranth Borsuk and husband, Brad Bouse. She leaves behind her Canadian nephews and nieces, Sam and Betsy Berliner, Assaf and Betty Drori and their families. She also leaves her beloved and closest friend of 80 years, Clara Lato. Rena and her mother, Clara Schoenthal, survived the Holocaust but lost the rest of their immediate family: father, grandmother and sister. She spent part of the war in the Lvov ghetto, under Russian and, later, Nazi control. She escaped the ghetto by selling her Mother's diamond ring so the two could pay to be smuggled out. They spent the rest of the war hidden in a sub-cellar. A Mrs. Tokazewicz was paid to hide them and another family. When they ran out of funds they were helped by an underground Polish organization, Zegota, which aided many Jewish fugitives. While in hiding, Rena met her first husband, Mathias Borsuk, whom she thought the last living Jewish young man in Europe. After the war Rena and her mother lived in the Neu Freimann displaced persons camp in Munich, where Rena studied voice at the Handel-Konservatorium and helped found a touring musical group, which performed at DP camps and brought pleasure to many fellow survivors. After emigrating to the U.S. in 1949, she divorced Mathias, and she and her mother settled in Rego Park, NY, where Rena continued singing for Jewish organizations while raising her infant son, Sherwin. She soon met her second husband, Moses Berliner, a survivor from Lodz, Poland. Because of his mechanical expertise, Moses and his brother Jack survived the Holocaust and Auschwitz as slave laborers fashioning propellers for the Nazis. Rena and Moses were the adoring parents of a daughter, Rochelle, and were very proud of their children's careers as a radiologist and lawyer, respectively. Though Rena lost her faith in God during the war, she never lost her connection to Judaism. She was president of the Tel Chai Chapter of Hadassah, and its area Vice President, in Queens, NY. She loved opera, which she once sang professionally, and despite paraplegia, which left her wheelchair-bound for the last fifteen years, her kindness and bright spirit remained undimmed. She was an inveterate dispenser of chocolate to everyone she met. She loved to read, and her home was filled with books. She read The New York Times daily, and was honored to be profiled on January 15, 2000. She loved all animals, plants, and children, and her dog, Mimi, was a source of much joy. She will be deeply missed by those whose lives she touched. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-06-26T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  BERLINER, RENA"}, "snippet": "BERLINER--Rena.
