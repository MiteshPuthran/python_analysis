Dr. Fridolin Sulser, who devoted his life to understanding the physiological basis of mental disorders and their treatment, died on January 3, 2016 at age 89, surrounded by loving family. He is survived by his brother, Emil Sulser of Maienfeld, Switzerland, wife, Johanna Mooser Sulser, and children Anna (Sulser) Newton, Adrian Sulser, Daniel Sulser, and Bettina (Sulser) Bryant, along with eight grandchildren and one great-grandchild. Dr. Sulser was born in Grabs, Switzerland and grew up in the town of Maienfeld, amidst his beloved Swiss Alps. He graduated from the Humanistische Gymnasium in Chur in 1947, attended Medical School at the University of Basel (pre-clinical) and the University of Zurich (clinical), graduating with an M.D. in 1955. He served as a medical officer in the Swiss Army, married the love of his life, Johanna, and moved with his wife and infant daughter to begin a position as assistant professor at the University of Bern. The family's great American adventure began in the fall of 1958 when Fridolin accepted a post-doctoral fellowship in Neuropsychopharmacology at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, M.D. Four years later, he went to Burroughs Wellcome Research Labs in New York as Head of Pharmacology. In 1965 he joined the Vanderbilt University Medical School Faculty as professor and Director of the Pharmacology Research Center, becoming a Professor Emeritus of the University in 2000. Dr. Sulser received many honors during his research career, including the prestigious Anna-Monika Prize, and was a Fellow and President of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology as well as a Fellow of the Collegium International Neuro-Psychopharmacolo- gium. He was a very proud father and grandfather, who celebrated the childrens' successes as they pursued their chosen paths. He found inspiration in nature, literature, philosophy and the fine arts.
