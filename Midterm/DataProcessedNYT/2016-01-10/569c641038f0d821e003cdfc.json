Judith S. The Fordham Law community is deeply saddened by the death of Hon. Judith S. Kaye, former Chief Judge of the New State Court of Appeals. She was a great friend of Fordham Law School and its alumni, particularly those serving in the state and federal judiciary. Over the years, she wrote for the Fordham Law Review and other journals, and she inspired students, graduates, and alumni with her remarks at the school's diploma ceremony, conferences, and lecture series. The school honored her in 2002 with the Fordham- Stein Prize, which is presented annually to a member of the legal profession whose work embodies the highest standards of the legal profession. In 2012, she participated in a special conversation alongside retired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor that canvassed their concerns about the election of judges, the importance of civic education and involvement for lawyers, and their pathbreaking appointments as the first women to hold their respective judicial roles. In addition to her jurisprudence, her administrative impact will leave an indelible mark on the office of Chief Judge of the State of New York. We extend our deepest sympathy to her colleagues at Skadden Arps and her family.
