The Historical Society of the New York Courts mourns the loss of our founder and guiding spirit, Judith S. Kaye. We recognize and celebrate that no one has had a more profound, positive impact on our court system. She was New York's first female, and longest serving, Chief Judge, and used her matchless energy and wisdom, heart and soul, to reshape the courts to improve the lives of countless people. She pioneered court innovations based on the premise that the legal system exists to serve the people with fairness and sensitivity. For this she was beloved, nationally and internationally. She neither sought nor basked in the accolades, acknowledging them with a shy smile and a handwritten note combining modesty and gratitude. She could be hilariously funny, but never at anyone else's expense. It is fitting that her memorial service will be held at Lincoln Center as the arts were important in her life, and she could be heard singing in the courthouse corridors. Judith once said she has a 5 to 9 job, arriving at 5am (often with grandmother photos to exchange with maintenance staff) leaving at 9pm, and yet she was always able to be there, undistracted, for her family and friends. Though as a historical society we focus on figures from the past, we were so fortunate to have had one of the nations' leading lights in our midst. She battled her illness with courage and dignity. It seemed to us that the day of her passing would somehow never come. But she was, after all, human.
