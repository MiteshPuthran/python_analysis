Dr. Berkowitz was born in New York City on August 11, 1926. He received his bachelor's degree from NYU and his Ph.D. from the University of Michigan. He served in the United States Army during WWII. Dr. Berkowitz was on the faculty of the University of Wisconsin at Madison from 1955 to 1989. He also held visiting appointments at Stanford, Oxford, Cambridge, and Cornell Universities.

Dr. Berkowitz was the author of over 170 articles and books, and is one of the most frequently cited psychologists of the twentieth century. After his retirement, he continued to write in his field, submitting his last article for publication on November 1, 2015. He was an avid world traveler, collector of modern art, follower of world events and opera-goer. Dr. Berkowitz was predeceased by his first wife, Nettie, in 1975. He is survived by his wife of forty years, Norma, and two daughters, two stepsons, five grandchildren, two step-grandsons and a brother. A memorial fund has been established in his honor for the benefit of Psychology graduate students at the UW- Madison.
