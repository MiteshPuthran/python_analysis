Born in Chicago on September 10, 1917, Paul was the only child of Elizabeth Bawden Wagner and Paul August Wagner.

Throughout his life his work focused on education and global communications in a pluralistic society. A Lieutenant Commander in the Navy during WWII, he was an education advisor at the Naval War College. After the war he taught at the University of Chicago and Columbia University.

At the age of 31 he was selected as the President of Rollins College in Florida, and was the youngest head of a college in the U.S. His mission: educate generalists-- male and female--who could love poetry and sports, math and science, and great books. He was the founding CEO of the Film Council of America--a Ford Foundation grantee. The organization supported the development of audiovisual educational tools, including documentary and educational films. Paul was a pioneer in the public relations profession. As a Senior Executive, he led the global education practice of Hill and Knowlton, the world's largest public relations organization. In the seventies, he founded his own public relations company--NPO Taskforce--to expand the work solely in the non-profit area. Upon his wife's retirement in 1999 as the Vice Chairman of The Estee Lauder Companies, they formed a pro bono group-- Nulli Secundus Associates--to aid clients from the non-profit world in the development of their strategies to be executed to success. They served many groups at no fee. Paul was a member of The Union League Club, The Yale Club, The Harvard Club, The Naval War College Foundation, and The University of Chicago Emeriti. In addition to his wife, he is survived by his daughter Paula A. Wagner, his son Paul A. Wagner III, and his daughter-in-law Helga Maurer Wagner. His many friends all write that \"an extraordinary human being is gone.\" \"His smile lit the room. His laugh filled the world.\" Paul loved his home and his friends in Sag Harbor. The family suggests that memorial gifts be directed to The Paul A. Wagner Scholar's Study, and The Paul A. Wagner Children's Room at the John Jermain Memorial Library.
