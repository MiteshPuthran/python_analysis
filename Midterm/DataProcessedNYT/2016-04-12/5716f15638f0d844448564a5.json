These ranged from household repairs, to the physics of baseball, to the molecular elements of cooking, etc. In recent years, he became interested in computer science, taking multiple online courses and once making so many corrections to an existing text, the author listed him as a contributor. He was a loving husband, father and grandfather who took pride in even our smallest accomplishments. He will remain forever in our hearts and minds.
