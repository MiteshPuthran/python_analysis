Norman graduated from Tufts University in 1968 and from Columbia Law School in 1972. Following his graduation, Norman clerked for the Honorable Charles M. Metzner, United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, until 1974. He then joined the law firm of Hughes Hubbard & Reed in Manhattan, where he worked until 2012 when his failing health prevented him from continuing. Norman was always in motion. He was an ardent traveler and reveled in planning adventurous journeys with his family. Norman was also an accomplished trial lawyer with many notable trials that led to his selection as a fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers. He was passionate about his work, devoted to his clients who chose him as their advocate, and loyal to his colleagues, training and inspiring a generation of attorneys at Hughes Hubbard & Reed where he chaired the litigation department. He loved to win, and nearly always did, while always adhering to the highest standards of the profession. Adversaries whom he had bested and judges who had presided over his cases remembered him with fondness and admiration years after their cases with Norman were over. His determination on behalf of his clients inspired those who worked for him to find reserves of stamina, persistence and creativity that they never knew they had. Norman had those qualities in abundance, and a magnificent ability to translate the hard work of the team into a devastating cross- examination or a winning argument to the court or jury. As devoted as he was to his profession, Norman was even more committed to his family, originally the three women in his life, then expanding to include his sons-in-law and grandchildren. Those who worked with Norman remember that even at the end of a long day preparing for trial, he never failed to call home to help with homework assignments or review college applications. And, just a few years ago, following another courtroom win, an Illinois jury was passing around pictures of his first grandchild. His vibrancy and courage live on in our hearts. Services will be held at Frank E. Campbell - The Funeral Chapel at 1076 Madison Avenue on Wednesday, May 4, at 1:30pm. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-05-04T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  KLEINBERG, NORMAN CHARLES"}, "snippet": "KLEINBERG--Norman Charles, beloved husband of Marcia; devoted father of Lauren and Joanna and father-in-law to their husbands Darren and Daniel; loving grandfather of Margot, Charlotte and Jake; and valued colleague of the partners of Hughes Hubbard & Reed, passed peacefully in his sleep on May 2, 2016.
