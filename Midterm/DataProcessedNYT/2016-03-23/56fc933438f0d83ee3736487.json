Justin Bruce Israel was born in New York City on June 23, 1927 and died suddenly March 21, 2016 in Southampton Hospital. He was the beloved husband of Emel Glicksman sharing 17 years of joyful adventure together. He is survived by his brother, Charles Israel, wife Sandy and daughter, Linda. Justin was the devoted father of Johnny, Lynn and Jon, Diane and Lindsey, Rob and Renee. And loving stepfather of Cindy and Joseph, Sally and Nina. He was the grandfather extraordinaire of Jorin, Avi, Mason, Caden, and Kyla and step- grandfather of Henry and Zoe. Justin grew up in New York's Upper West Side attending Columbia Grammar School where he excelled and was admitted to Yale University at the age of 16, graduating in 1949 after a hiatus of military service. His love for business and passion for quality along with his razor sharp mind, launched him from his start at Regal Knitwear into a stellar career of 50 years as a entrepreneurial dean and industry leader in the Children's apparel business. He was co-founder of Justin Charles (with his brother Charles) and after a successful sale then founded another successful childrenswear business, Knitwaves. As the father of a child with severe developmental disabilities, Justin was passionate about raising money and awareness on behalf of those with development challenges. He served many roles at Westchester ARC, raised millions of dollars, and helped to fund the Gleeson-Israel Gateway Center in Westchester, NY. For Justin, there was no such thing as retirement and he was an extraordinary unrelenting public servant and fundraiser, a teacher of public service in his actions and deeds, and a leader and protector of the voiceless, the physically-challenged, and our endangered environment. His second career was as a volunteer fundraiser and philanthropist at numerous organizations, most notably Sierra Club, United Jewish Appeal, Fashion Institute of Technology and New York Public Media (WNET). The CEO of WNET described Justin as a dedicated volunteer for almost a decade. \"At 88 years young, Justin was a critical member of the Development Department.\" His special fundraising strategy was telling donors, \"I am celebrating my 39th birthday for the 49th time.\" We honor Justin as a role model and example of an avid athlete and lover of tennis, paddle tennis and biking and a patron of the arts, including a huge sponsor of the Pearl Theater-introducing theater followed by a high cholesterol meal at the Second Avenue Deli to numerous fans. Justin and Emel shared a passion for Opera and the New York City Ballet, Carnegie Hall and Bridge. They travelled all over the world but his favorite was the yearly visits to Istanbul and sailing the coast of Turkey with friends. He also cherished his beloved property in Vermont that he shared with his children since 1967. He will be remembered for his fearlessness, his love of life and the outdoors, his early care of the environment (he started recycling in the 1960's!) as well as his brilliant, razor-sharp mind, compassion and caring for others, willingness to take a stand, a passionate newspaper clipper and correspondent, deep caring for humanity and the good of the planet. His service and his concern for everyone around him knew no bounds and he never let up, not for a day. He was always thinking of ways to help others be their best selves. He loved, he gave, he taught, he shared, he lived, he was engaged, he made a difference, and his work will carry on. We love you forever and will miss you always. A memorial service for Justin will be held this Thursday, March 24th at 2pm at Frank E. Campbell - The Funeral Chapel (1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street). Immediately following the service, Shiva will be held at Justin and Emel's apartment until 8pm on Thursday, and 5-8pm on Friday.
