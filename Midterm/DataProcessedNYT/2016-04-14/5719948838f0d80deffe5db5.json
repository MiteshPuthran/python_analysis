Born in Hartford, CT, he was the son of Paul W. Cooley and Jane Crary Allen. He was a graduate of St. Paul's School '56, Yale University '60, and the Columbia University Business School. He is survived by his sisters Sarah Martin and her husband Bob, of Essex, CT, Clare Edwards and her husband Jared, of West Hartford, CT and his brother Jeffrey Cooley and his wife Betsey, of Old Lyme, CT. He is also survived by his nephews Whitman Seymour (Lisa), David Seymour (Anna), Christopher Seymour, and Jonathan Edwards (Allison) and 10 great-nieces and nephews. In addition, he is survived by his aunt, Mary Crary of Farmington, CT. His wife, Mary Mendenhall Cooley predeceased him. After graduating from business school he took a different path and had a life filled with sustaining friendships and intellectual discovery. Chris and Mary took up partial residence in Venice in the early 1970's and immersed themselves in the history and culture of the city, in a stimulating and congenial society, and in the ebb and flow of daily life. Their garden and hospitality became magnets for friends from near and far. A tour of the city or a visit to any museum with Chris was to experience it through the eyes of an impassioned guide and true scholar. Chris collected beautiful things and people who interested him. His appreciation for and understanding of art, history, and music, coupled with his enviable memory and love of a good story or joke, made him a companion much in demand by his many devoted friends. As an inquiring traveller, Chris especially valued his trips and excursions with friends and family, and particularly, in later years, with the Fortress Study Group to sites throughout Great Britain and Europe. He was a member of the Grolier Club and the Yale Club of New York. Donations may be made in his memory to Save Venice Inc., 133 E. 58th St., New York, NY 10022 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-04-14T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  COOLEY, CHRISTOPHER"}, "snippet": "COOLEY--Christopher, born February 23, 1938, died unexpectedly at home in New York City in early March.
