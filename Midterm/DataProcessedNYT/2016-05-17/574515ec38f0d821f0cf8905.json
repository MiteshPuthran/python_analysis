The Trustees and Staff of The Museum of Modern Art mourn the loss of Carolyn Lanchner, a longtime curator in the Museum's Department of Painting and Sculpture. Carolyn joined The Museum of Modern Art in 1967 and retired in 1998. During her illustrious career she organized and co-organized outstanding exhibitions that include Sophie Taeuber-Arp (1981), Henri Rousseau (1985), Paul Klee (1987), Joan Miro (1993), Fernand Leger (1998), and Alberto Giacometti (2001). Carolyn was widely admired for her impeccable eye, scholarly rigor, and diplomatic aplomb. She was a beloved friend of many artists both in New York and Paris. Always generous with her time, ideas, and encouragement, she was a cherished and inspiring mentor to a host of younger curators. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Carolyn's daughter Renate, her son David, her son-in-law Collins, her daughter-in-law Kirsten, and her grandson John. A memorial service will be held on Wednesday, June 8th, at 9:30 a.m. in the Roy and Niuta Titus Theater 1 at The Museum of Modern Art. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-05-17T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  LANCHNER, CAROLYN"}, "snippet": "LANCHNER--Carolyn.
