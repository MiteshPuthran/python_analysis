The World Jewish Congress mourns the passing of one of the preeminent Jewish thinkers, human rights activists, authors, teachers, and moral authorities of our age, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Elie Wiesel. After surviving the horrors of Auschwitz and Buchenwald, Elie Wiesel taught the world the true meaning of remembrance and dedicated himself to fighting evil, bigotry and xenophobia in all its forms. More than anyone else, he ensured that the victims of the Shoah would be remembered, not only for how they were murdered, but for who they were and how they lived. We are proud to have counted him among the dearest friends of the World Jewish Congress, and that we were privileged to honor him with the Guardian of Jerusalem Prize in 2010, and with our highest honor, the Theodor Herzl Award, in 2013. We extend our deepest condolences and those of our more than 100 affiliated Jewish communities across the globe to his wife and life partner Marion, his cherished son Elisha, daughter-in-law Lynn, stepdaughter Jennifer, his beloved grandchildren, and his entire family. May his memory be a blessing and an eternal inspiration to us all. Ronald S. Lauder, President David de Rothschild, Chairman, Governing Board Chella Safra, Treasurer Robert Singer, CEO 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-07-06T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  WIESEL, ELIE"}, "snippet": "WIESEL--Elie.
