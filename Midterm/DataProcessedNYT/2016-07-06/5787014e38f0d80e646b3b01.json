He worked hard all of his life as a laborer, doing great harm to his body to provide well for his family. In his retirement, he became an accomplished wood worker and happily attended to his rose garden. His greatest joy came from his wife of 57 years and his four granddaughters, with whom he was smitten. Anthony is survived by his loving wife, Sydney; devoted son Anthony of Pleasanton CA, and grandchildren, Jessica Bettencourt of New York City, NY, Candace Bettencourt of San Francisco, CA, Ashley Bettencourt of San Francisco, CA, and Tory Bettencourt of Boston, MA.
