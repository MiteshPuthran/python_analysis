February 29, 1924 - May 6, 2016. Founder and principle of GemcoWare manufacturing, took the last exit after a full and loving life to fly to the moon and play among the stars. A prince of a man once nicknamed Duke. Quiet and quick-witted. Handsome and humble. He was a creator and a provider, a wholehearted husband and father - and a pretty snappy dresser! Principled, honest, kind and caring. A man of style and substance and of gentle strength and humor whose generosity and soul are etched into the hearts and minds of the many he touched throughout his long life. But none more so than his eternal flame and beautiful wife of 70 years, Marilyn - as well as his adoring sons, Derek and Bobby, his daughter-in-law Debbie and his cherished grandson, Ryan. His passing is an end- of-an-era loss. He will be missed till all he knew are gone. We honor him in memory of his departed son, Howard, his parents, Harry and Ceil, and his brother, Mel. Funeral services will be held at Gutterman Warheit Chappel 7240 North Federal Highway Boca Raton Monday, May 9 at noon. A graveside service will be held Wednesday at 11am at Beth Moses cemetery in New York.
