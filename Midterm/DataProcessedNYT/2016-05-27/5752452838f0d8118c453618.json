The Downtown Alliance mourns the passing of our Chief Operating and Chief Financial Officer, Bill Bernstein, a former city official who played a significant role in shaping our vision and work for nearly two decades. Starting at the Alliance in 1997, he served as acting president three times and helped guide the Alliance during several tumultuous periods in Lower Manhattan's history, including the attacks of September 11, 2001 and Hurricane Sandy. Before joining the Downtown Alliance, Bill was the First Deputy Executive Director of the New York City Department of City Planning for more than ten years. Prior to this, he worked for the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development's Rent Control Division and for the New York City Loft Board. Esteemed by the staff at the Alliance and a beloved mentor to many, he was an avuncular presence and was often sought after for advice of both a professional and personal nature.

A longtime resident of Flatbush, Brooklyn, Bill attended New York City public schools, including Stuyvesant High School, and graduated from City College of New York and New York University School of Business.
