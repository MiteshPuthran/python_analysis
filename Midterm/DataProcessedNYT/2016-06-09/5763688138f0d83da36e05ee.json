For the last 53 years, he also spent as much time as he could at his farm in Washington County, NY. Lester was born February 8, 1918 to David and Helen Migdal in Brooklyn, NY. He attended public schools in Brooklyn and graduated from City College of New York, where he studied philosophy, and from Harvard Law School. His marriage of 28 years to Ellen Marcus MigdaI ended on her death in August, 1970. His second marriage of 38 years to Eleanor Jackson Burt Migdal ended on her death in March, 2013. He is survived by five children: Joanna Migdal, Eliza Migdal, David Migdal, Kaethe Burt-O'Dea and Sarah Burt, twelve grandchildren, nine great- grandchildren, and his brother, Dr. Walter Migdal. Lester served during the Second World War as a captain in the Army combat engineers. After the Battle of the Bulge, he commanded a company that under heavy fire built one of the pontoon bridges across the Rhine River which the allied armies crossed to defeat Germany; Lester loved the law, which he practiced in New York City for over 50 years, at his own firm. His cases ranged from the defense of a victim of the McCarthy witch hunts to the representation of extended families, in all legal matters from marriage and children to death and taxes, to more public matters argued and won at the U.S. Supreme Court. Many of his clients became his close friends. Lester collected thousands of books. With insatiable curiosity and a lifetime of insomnia, he read them all. He was particularly interested in literature, criticism and poetry. In his later years, intensely missing both his wives he found special solace in poetry. Lester valued his close relationship with his family and friends. A few nights before he died he played poker with a group of friends in a game that had lasted forty years. Lester will be remembered for his intelligence, wit, fearlessness, and gentility. He maintained his talent for respectful kindness, and the easy and intense connections with others which flowed from that, until the day he died. A memorial will be held for Lester later this summer at the Harvard Club, 35 W. 44th St., New York City. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-06-09T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  MIGDAL, LESTER CHARLES"}, "snippet": "MIGDAL--Lester Charles, died May 31 at his home of 60 years on 92nd Street in New York City.
