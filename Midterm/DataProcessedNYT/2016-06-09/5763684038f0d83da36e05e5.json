John. Real Estate developer R. John Punnett died peacefully on Monday, June 6th at his home in Manhattan. He was 89 years old. Born in Zemun, Yugoslavia on February 8, 1927 to Tamara Gert and RAF pilot Schuyler Punnett, John and his sister Lydia were raised first in Greece, and later moving to Nantes, France where they lived during the German occupation. Being fluent in English, French, and Russian, he joined the RAF at age 17 and was stationed in Cairo and in Baghdad working in the Intelligence division. At the end of the war he was granted a full scholarship to attend the University of Cambridge, where he earned a BA in Russian literature. In 1956 he joined his sister in New York where he remained throughout his life. With a loan from his mother, in 1962 he began a career in real estate and founded Punnett Realty Company, eventually owning and managing up to 30 buildings largely centered in the Yorkville neighborhood. Always dressed in his trademark English suits, John was extremely respected in his field and known by everyone as a true gentleman. This was reflected by the fact that most of his employees had been with him for several decades. His work ethic was inspiring to many. Rarely taking a day off, he continued to go to his office until recently. There were few things John enjoyed more than spending time with his numerous friends and growing family and he described his six grandchildren as his \"brood\". He was most at peace in his Southampton home, where he maintained a residence for over four decades. He was predeceased by his sister Lydia Wasserman and is survived by his wife Carol, his son Anthony, daughters Dominique, Daniela, and his grandchildren Tatiana, Alexi, Kayden, Lucas, Olivia, and Alexandra. John will be missed for his generosity, his dry sense of humor, his keen intellect, and his love of the arts. He will be remembered by his family as a great father, teacher, and wonderful provider. Funeral services will be held at Brockett Funeral Home in Southampton on Saturday, June 11th, beginning at 10am. Memorial donations to the R. John Punnett Foundation, 107 Lee Ave., Southampton, NY 11968 would be appreciated. 1", "pub_date": "2016-06-09T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Memorials  PUNNETT, R.
