Longtime resident of Manhasset, NY died June 7, 2016 at St. Francis Hospital after a brief illness, surrounded by her family. She was 90.

Armstrong, as well as many loving nieces and nephews. The only child of Edward Francis and Mary (Daly) Fitzgerald, she grew up in the Bronx, attending Ursuline Academy, Maplehurst Academy and Manhattanville College, on an academic scholarship, graduating in 1946. As a senior, she won Vogue Magazine's Prix de Paris essay contest and spent the next year working for the magazine in Manhattan. She married Jack Brennan in 1948 at St. Francis de Sales Church in Rockaway, NY, and they had 10 children. In 1957, the family moved to Manhasset, where for nearly six decades she was a deeply committed community volunteer and activist involved in, most notably, St. Mary's of Manhasset Parish. She served as a Eucharistic Minister, Lector, Blood Bank Coordinator, and member of the Parish Council. She also worked with the Manhattanville Alumni Association, the AAUW and the League of Women Voters. While raising her children, she earned a Masters of Arts in Liberal Studies at Manhattanville. After all 10 children finished college, she resumed her journalism career beginning at the Port Washington News, and later as editor of the Manhasset Press. Eventually, she was editing eight papers for Anton Community Newspapers. The Manhasset Rotary Club and Chamber of Commerce honored her. In Manhasset, Eileen and Jack made many beloved friends and the family knows they grieve with us now. A wake will be held at Fairchild and Sons in Manhasset on Friday; 2 to 5pm and 7 to 9pm. There will be a funeral Mass at St. Mary's at 9am sharp on Saturday followed by interment at Gate of Heaven Cemetery.
