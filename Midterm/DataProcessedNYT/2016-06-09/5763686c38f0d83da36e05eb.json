Roger was born on November 11, 1944 in Chisholm, MN, the son of Anthony and Rose Marie Parucci Enrico. He earned a B.S. in Business Administration from Babson College, and served in the U.S. Navy during the Vietnam War, stationed in Vietnam. Recruited to PepsiCo in 1971, Roger spent 32 distinguished years with the company, ultimately attaining chairmanship. A visionary marketer and risk taker, he was the competitive catalyst at Pepsi-Cola behind Coca-Cola's unprecedented reformulation of its flagship soft drink. He transformed PepsiCo's Frito-Lay global snack food businesses, and oversaw PepsiCo's Worldwide Restaurants (Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC.) He re-conceptualized PepsiCo, separating foods and beverages and spinning off restaurants into the successful YUM! Brands. Roger was a champion of front line workers, anonymously donating his salary to fund scholarships for their children. Following PepsiCo, Roger was courted out of retirement by DreamWorks Animation (DWA) CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg to chair the company through its IPO. He served for eight years at a pivotal moment in DWA's growth and evolution. Roger served on numerous corporate boards and the boards of the American Film Institute, the American Prairie Reserve, the Environmental Defense Fund, KERA, and the National Geographic Society. An active but quiet philanthropist, he was eager and generous to help others. Not only a great citizen and businessman, Roger was a loyal friend to many. Roger is survived by his childhood sweetheart and loving wife of 48 years, Rosemary Margo Enrico; their son Aaron and his wife Catherine, and their children, Daniel, Gisele and Joseph, all of Dallas. A public celebration of Roger's life will be held on Monday, June 13, 2016 at 10am at Christ the King Catholic Church, 8107 Preston Road, Dallas, TX. Contributions may be made to The Roger and Rosemary Enrico Foundation, supporting social services, outreach and education for the underprivileged, environmental conservancy and medical research.
