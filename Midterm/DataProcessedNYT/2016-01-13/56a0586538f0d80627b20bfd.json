The partners of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP mourn the passing of dear friend and former partner, Michael H. Diamond. A highly regarded lawyer who made a tremendous impact on the litigation field in Los Angeles and beyond, Mike joined Milbank in 2000 as partner and head of the Litigation Group in the Firm's Los Angeles office. Prior to joining Milbank, he spent 23 years at Skadden, Arps, where he opened and expanded the firm's Los Angeles office. After retiring from Milbank in 2007, Mike founded a successful consulting and expert witness firm, MHD Group. During his career, he advised numerous corporations and their officers, directors and shareholders, on complex and high-profile disputes. Mike was also dedicated to pro bono work, applying his legal skills to a wide range of matters. These included the merger of Brandeis-Bardin Institute with the University of Judaism, which formed the American Jewish University, and his successful defense of journalists in a case related to the 2000 Democratic National Convention, which earned him recognition from the ACLU Foundation of Southern California. He held degrees from Brown University and Columbia University Law School. We extend our deepest sympathies to Mike's wife, Marilyn, his four children Seth, Cory, Beth and Debra and ten grandchildren, and to his entire family. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-01-13T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  DIAMOND, MICHAEL H"}, "snippet": "DIAMOND--Michael H.
